# Introduction

I want to write a script here to be able to recursively obtain all the dataset metadaya in the GEO databse for the childhood dementias. 

I will start as a proof of principal for mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) diseases, as this has a nice keyword. 

```{r}
# Search GEO database for the term "mucopolysaccharidoses"
search_results <- entrez_search(db = "gds", term = "mucopolysaccharidoses")

# Get GEO accessions (GSE IDs)
geo_accessions <- search_results$ids


# get more info. 
# this takes a while
record_summaries <- lapply(geo_accessions, 
                           function(id) entrez_summary(db = "gds", id = id)
                           )
```

The GEO database (GDS) was searched with the package rentrez for the term "mucopolysaccharidoses". This returned `r search_results$count` datasets. 

```{r}
lapply(record_summaries, function(x) {
  tibble(
    accession = x$accession,    # GEO accession number
    title = x$title,            # Title of the dataset
    summary = x$summary        # Summary/description
  )
}) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "800px")
```

This works nicely! Now will extend to more disorders
