The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  output/cdi_keywords.csv

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/all_childhooddementias.rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III, Sanfilippo syndrome) is a
lysosomal storage disease belonging to the group of
mucopolysaccharidoses and characterised by severe and rapid intellectual
deterioration. There are 4 types, each due to the deficiency of a
different enzyme. Attenuated forms with milder symptoms and slower
progression exist.

<td style="text-align:left;">
Typically, disease onset is before ten years of age. For the severe
phenotype (more common) symptoms can present around 2 years, while age
of onset for the attenuated form is around 4 years of age. A weighted

4.2|A weighted average of the age of diagnosis of the subtypes was used.
Misdiagnosis is common, especially in the early stages of the disease.
Common misdiagnoses include autism, ADHD, and idiopathic developmental
delay. For patients with an attenuated form, diagnosis may be as late as
adulthood, or patients may even remain undiagnosed; in one Dutch study,
which included 33 attenuated MPS IIIB patients, the median age at
diagnosis was 28 years. A family history of Sanfilippo syndrome may lead
to a quicker diagnosis after symptom onset.

In Australia, the age of diagnosis ranges from 0.7-8.0, with a median
age of 2.3 (Chin and Fuller, 2021). Misdiagnosis is common, especially
in the early stages of the disease. Common misdiagnoses include autism,
ADHD, and idiopathic developmental delay. Diagnosis can vary - in one
study of living and deceased patients, the age of definitive MPS IIIC
diagnosis for 11 patients was between the ages of 2 and 7 with a mean of
4.5 years. One patient was an outlier with a diagnosis at 42 years old
(Rujter et al., 2008)

Misdiagnosis is common, especially in the early stages of the disease.
Due to the rarity of MPS IIID, the average age at diagnosis is
approximate. Age at diagnosis may vary; diagnosis may be earlier if
there is a family history of Sanfilippo syndrome. In a french study of 6
participants, the median age of diagnosis was 8.2 +/- 5.2 years (Héron
et al., 2011).

breakdown of host- microbe homeostasis. Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent condition in which quantitative and qualitative changes of the oral microbiota (dysbiosis) trigger non-resolving chronic inflammation, progressive bone loss and ultimately tooth loss. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of local sustained delivery of the myeloid-recruiting chemokine CCL2 in murine ligature-induced PD using clinically relevant models as a preventive, interventional or reparative therapy. Local delivery of CCL2 into the periodontium inhibited bone loss and accelerated bone gain that could be ascribed to reduced osteoclasts numbers. CCL2 treatment upregulated M2-macrophage and downregulated pro-inflammatory and pro-osteoclastic markers. Furthermore, single cell RNA sequencing indicated that CCL2 therapy reversed disease-associated transcriptomic profiles of murine gingival macrophages via inhibiting TREM-1 signaling in classically activated macrophages and inducing PKA signaling in infiltrating macrophages. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing showed mitigation of microbial dysbiosis in the periodontium that correlated with a reduction in microbial load in CCL2- treated mice. This study reveals a novel protective effect of CCL2 local delivery in PD as a model for chronic inflammatory diseases caused by a disturbance in host-microbe homeostasis.","Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders . A subgroup of LSDs is called Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), where accumulation of glycosaminoglycans causes a progressive degenerative disorder. The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly impacted with developmental delays, neurological regression, and early mortality. Current treatments are often insufficient to fully address the clinical need. Here we report the use of microglia derived from healthy human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as a potential one-time, allogeneic off-the-shelf cell therapy for several MPS. iPSC-derived microglia, termed MG01   , are replete with wild-type levels of lysosomal enzymes and we show that MG01 can deliver the functional enzyme into four different MPS knockout cell lines via mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated endocytosis in vitro. We then show that a single administration of MG01 provides sufficient enzyme to prevent behavioral deficits in two different animal models of MPS, efficacious to at least eight months after transplantation.","The epidermis, the most superficial layer of human skin, serves a critical barrier function, protecting the body from external pathogens and allergens. Dysregulation in the epidermal differentiation process contributes to barrier dysfunction and is implicated in the pathology of various dermatological diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate (MPS) is used as a moisturizing agent for xerosis in AD patients. However, its mechanism of action on keratinocytes, the main constituent of the epidermis, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of MPS on keratinocytes by subjecting adult human epidermal keratinocyte (HEKa) cells and three-dimensional cultured keratinocytes to MPS treatment, followed by transcriptome analysis. The analysis revealed that MPS treatment enhances keratinocyte differentiation and suppresses proliferation. We focused on amphiregulin (AREG), a membrane protein that belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and possesses a heparin-binding domain, as a significant target of the MPS among the genes altered by MPS. It is revealed that MPS exerts an inhibitory effect directly on AREG, rather than on the EGF receptor or other members of the EGF family. Furthermore, it is suggested that AREG leads to a reduction in epidermal barrier function, whereas MPS contributes to barrier enhancement through AREG inhibition. Collectively, these findings suggest that MPS modulates barrier function through the inhibition of AREG, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for skin barrier restoration.","In eukaryotes, methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me) catalyzed by the complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS) is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of genes and the development of organisms. In Monascus, the functions of COMPASS in establishing H3K4me remain unclear. This study first identified the conserved COMPASS core subunits MpSet1 and MpSwd3 in Monascus purpureus and confirmed their roles in establishing H3K4me2/3. Loss of MpSet1 and MpSwd3 resulted in slower growth and development and inhibited the formation of cleistothecia, ascospores, and conidia. The loss of these core subunits also decreased the production of extracellular and intracellular Monascus pigments (MPs) by 94.2%, 93.5%, 82.7%, and 82.5%, respectively. In addition, RNA high-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that the loss of MpSet1 and MpSwd3 altered the expression of 2646 and 2659 genes, respectively, and repressed the transcription of MPs synthesis-related genes. In addition, the ΔMpset1 and ΔMpswd3 strains demonstrated increased sensitivity to cell wall stress with the downregulation of chitin synthase-coding genes. These results indicated that the COMPASS core subunits MpSet1 and MpSwd3 help establish H3K4me2/3 for growth and development, spore formation, and pigment synthesis in Monascus. These core subunits also assist in maintaining cell wall integrity.","Current research on metabolic disorders and diabetes relies on animal models because multi-organ diseases cannot be well studied with the standard in vitro assays. Here, we connect models of key metabolic organs, pancreas and liver, on a microfluidic chip to enable diabetes research in a human-based preclinical system. Aided by mechanistic mathematical modelling, we show that hyperglycemia and high cortisone induce glucose dysregulation in the pancreas-liver microphysiological system (MPS) mimicking a diabetic phenotype seen in patients with glucocorticoid-induced diabetes. In this diseased condition, pancreas-liver MPS displays beta-cell dysfunction, steatosis, elevated ketone-body secretion, increased glycogen storage, and upregulated gluconeogenic gene expression. In turn, a physiological culture condition rescues the glucose tolerance and beta cell function. This method was evaluated for repeatability in two laboratories and was effective in multiple pancreatic islet donors. The model also provides a platform to identify new therapeutic targets as demonstrated with a combined transcriptome and proteome analysis.","In this study, we sought to analyze the effects of genetic variants on gene expression levels in relation to the history of infectious disease and cell type. To do this, we focused on a Peruvian human cohort that had been previously genotyped who either progressed to active tuberculosis (TB) disease (cases) or did not progress to TB (controls). We isolated monocytes from PBMC samples of these individuals and differentiated in vitro to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MPs). We performed RNA-seq for each sample using a modified Smart-seq protocol for low-input RNA-sequencing. We measured the impact of genetic variants on gene expression by identifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We identified cell-type-specific eQTL genes as well as five genes that showed an interaction between eQTL variants and TB progression status in dendritic cells. We found that the top eQTL interaction with disease history was associated with a gene involved in tyrosine catabolism. ","We characterized n=134 HNSCC by Quantseq 3´-RNA-sequencing for their transcriptional profiles in order to analyze differential expression of clinically relevant subgroups, define transcriptionally defined molecular subgroups and to characterize the tumor microenvironment by gene expression devonvolution approaches.","Since its first description in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been the most common type of dementia. Initially thought to be caused by age-associated accumulation of plaques, in recent years, research has increasingly associated AD with lysosomal storage and metabolic disorders, and the explanation of its pathogenesis has shifted from amyloid and tau accumulation to oxidative stress and impaired lipid and glucose metabolism aggravated by hypoxic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms linking those cellular processes and conditions to disease progression have yet to be defined. Here, we applied a disease similarity approach to identify unknown molecular targets of AD by using transcriptomic data from congenital diseases known to increase AD risk, namely Down Syndrome, Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC), and Mucopolysaccharidoses I. We uncovered common pathways, hub genes, and miRNAs across in vitro and in vivo models of these diseases as potential molecular targets for neuroprotection and amelioration of AD pathology, many of which have never been associated with AD. We then investigated common molecular alterations in brain samples from an NPC disease mouse model by juxtaposing them with brain samples of both human and mouse models of AD. Detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses revealed the NPCmut mouse as a novel, short-lived in vivo model of AD characterized by accelerated brain aging, concluding that the NPCmut mouse model can serve as a potential short-lived in vivo model for AD research and for understanding molecular factors affecting brain aging. This research represents the first comprehensive approach to congenital disease association with neurodegeneration and a new perspective on AD research while highlighting shortcomings and lack of correlation in diverse in vitro models. Considering the lack of an AD mouse model that recapitulates the physiological hallmarks of brain aging, the characterization of a short-lived NPC mouse model will further accelerate the research in these fields and offer a unique model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD from a perspective of accelerated brain aging.","The advent of micro-physiological systems (MPS) in biomedical research has enabled the introduction of more complex and relevant physiological into in vitro models. The recreation of complex morphological features in three-dimensional environments can recapitulate otherwise absent dynamic interactions in conventional models. In this study we developed an advanced in vitro Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) that mimics the interplay between healthy and malignant renal tissue. Based on the TissUse Humimic platform our model combines healthy renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) and RCC. Co-culturing reconstructed RPTEC tubules with RCC spheroids in a closed micro-perfused circuit resulted in significant phenotypical changes to the tubules. Expression of immune factors revealed that interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α) were upregulated in the non-malignant cells while neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was downregulated in both RCC and RPTEC. Metabolic analysis revealed that RCC prompted a shift in the energy production of RPTEC tubules, inducing glycolysis, in a metabolic adaptation that likely supports RCC growth and immunogenicity. In contrast, RCC maintained stable metabolic activity, emphasizing their resilience to external factors. RNA-seq and biological process analysis of primary RTPTEC tubules demonstrated that the 3D tubular architecture and MPS conditions reverted cells to a predominant oxidative phosphorylate state, a departure from the glycolytic metabolism observed in 2D culture. This dynamic RCC co-culture model, approximates the physiology of healthy renal tubules to that of RCC, providing new insights into tumor-host interactions. Our approach can show that an RCC-MPS can expand the complexity and scope of pathophysiology and biomarker studies in kidney cancer research.","To investigate the gene expression in the regulation of neuron differentiation between healthy human control and MPS II. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using mRNAs of 3 healthy human control iPSC- and 9 MPS II-iPSC-dervied 15 weeks neurons.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","When treated with FGF8+10, LM makers were upregulated and the expression levels were higher than that of the Mock cells.","Previously, we reported that human primary (SW480) and metastatic (SW620) colorectal (CRC) cells secrete (shed) midbody remnants (MBRs), exosomes (Exos), and microparticles (MPs) are molecularly distinct at the protein level. To gain further biochemical insights into MBRs, Exos, and MPs and their emerging role in CRC, we performed, and report here for the first time, a comprehensive transcriptome and long noncoding RNA sequencing analysis and fusion gene identification of these three EV classes using the next-generation RNA sequencing technique. Differential transcript expression analysis revealed that MBRs have a distinct transcriptomic profile compared to Exos and MPs with a high enrichment of mitochondrial transcripts lncRNA/pseudogene transcripts that are predicted to bind to ribonucleoprotein complexes, spliceosome and RNA/stress granule proteins. A salient finding from this study is a high enrichment of several fusion genes in MBRs compared to Exos, MPs and cell lysates from their parental cells such as MSH2 (gene encoded DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2). This suggests potential EV-liquid biopsy targets for cancer detection. Importantly, the expression of cancer progression-related transcripts found in EV classes derived from SW480 (EGFR) and SW620 (MET and MACCA1) cell lines reflects their parental cell types. Our study is the first discovery of RNA and fusion gene compositions within MBRs (including Exos and MPs) that could have an impact on EV functionality in cancer progression and detection using EV-based RNA/ fusion gene candidates for cancer biomarkers","Control vs nanoparticle, microparticle, metal chloride exposed","After myocardial infarction (MI), the heart fails to renew, and the cardiac microenvironment is irreversibly disrupted. Inactivation of the Hippo signaling pathway can rebuild the post ischemic microenvironment and improve cardiac function. We investigated spatially resolved cellular relationships of neonatal and adult renewal-competent hearts to gain insight into inefficient mammalian heart renewal. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell sequencing of adult control hearts and hearts expressing YAP5SA, an active version of the Hippo signaling pathway effector YAP, which models heart renewal, revealed a conserved, renewal-competent cardiomyocyte (CM) population in control hearts and amplified in YAP5SA hearts. This CM population was also found in the wildtype, renewal competent neonatal heart after myocardial infarction, as well as the adult human heart. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), expressing complement C3, colocalized with these CMs. In YAP5SA hearts and neonatal hearts post-MI, macrophages (MPs) expressing complement receptor C3ar1 also colocalized, creating a pro-renewal niche composed of the CM, CF and MP triad. Both C3 and C3ar1 loss-of-function in YAP5SA hearts similarly suppressed heart renewal, indicating that C3-expressing CFs, C3ar1-expressing MPs, and complement system signaling play a direct role in heart renewal","Blood vessels show various COVID-19-related conditions including thrombosis and cytokine propagation. Existing in vitro blood vessel models cannot represent the consequent changes in the vascular structure or determine the initial infection site, making it difficult to evaluate how epithelial and endothelial tissues are damaged. Here, we developed a microphysiological system (MPS) that co-culture the bronchial organoids and the vascular bed to analyze infection site and interactions. In this system, virus-infected organoids caused damage in vascular structure. However, vasculature was not damaged or infected when the virus was directly introduced to vascular bed. The knockout of interferon-related genes and inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway reduced the vascular damage, indicating the protective effect of interferon response suppression. The results demonstrate selective infection of bronchial epithelial cells and vascular damage by cytokines and also indicate the applicability of MPS to investigate how the infection influences vascular structure and functions. ","We carried out Massive Parallel Sequencing (MPS) to reveal circulating miRNA profiles of 96 patients to distinguish the radiographic and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. The sequencing platform identified 1900 miRNA species, out of which 432 miRNAs were present with the base mean, computed by DESeq2, more than 10. We identified 48 miRNAs, which were different in PBMCs in patients with axial spondyloarthritis compared to healthy controls.","Classical methods of investigating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are generally performed in non-living systems, yet in recent years new technologies utilizing proximity labeling (PL) have given researchers the tools to explore proximal PPIs in living systems. PL has distinct advantages over traditional protein interactome studies, such as the ability to identify weak and transient interactions in vitro and in vivo. Most PL studies are performed on targets within or on the cell membrane. We have adapted the original PL method to investigate PPIs within the extracellular compartment, using both BioID2 and TurboID, that we term extracellular PL (ePL). To demonstrate the utility of this modified technique, we investigate the interactome of the widely expressed matrisome protein Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2). Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are a family of multi-functional proteins that were initially defined by their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of metalloproteinases (MPs), the major mediators of extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown and turnover. TIMP2 exhibits a broad expression profile and is often abundant in both normal and diseased tissues. Understanding the functional transformation of matrisome regulators, like TIMP2, during the evolution of tissue microenvironments associated with disease progression is essential for the development of ECM targeted therapeutics. Using carboxyl- and amino-terminal fusion proteins of TIMP2 with BioID2 and TurboID, we describe the TIMP2 proximal interactome. We also illustrate how the TIMP2 interactome changes in the presence of different stimuli, in different cell types, in unique culture conditions (2D vs 3D), and with different reaction kinetics (BioID2 vs. TurboID); demonstrating the power of this technique versus classical PPI methods. We propose that the screening of matrisome targets in disease models using ePL will reveal new therapeutic targets for further comprehensive studies.","Selective protein degradation typically involves substrate recognition via short linear motifs known as degrons. Various degrons can be found at protein termini from bacteria to mammals. While N-degrons have been extensively studied, our understanding of C-degrons is still limited. Towards a comprehensive understanding of eukaryotic C-degron pathways, we performed an unbiased survey of C-degrons in budding yeast. We identified over 5000 potential C-degrons by stability profiling of random peptide libraries and of the yeast C-terminome. Combining machine learning, high-throughput mutagenesis and genetic screens revealed that the SCF ubiquitin ligase targets ~40% of degrons using a single F-box substrate receptor Das1. Although sequence-specific, Das1 is highly promiscuous, recognizing a variety of C-degron motifs. By screening for full-length substrates, we implicate SCFDas1 in degradation of orphan protein complex subunits. Altogether, this work highlights the variety of C-degron pathways in eukaryotes and uncovers how an SCF/C-degron pathway of broad specificity contributes to proteostasis.","Coculture of hepatocytes with small intestine cells using MPS have been shown to enhance hepatic drug metabolism, yet the crosstalk mechanism is still unclear. Coculture of PXB-cells and iPS-derived intestine cells in MPS with perfusion and direct oxygenation were conducted to investigate this crosstalk. Analysis on albumin secretion, CYP enzyme actvity and differentially expressed genes confirmed that perfusion and direct oxygenation enhanced PXB-cells. Upregulation of \"epoxygenase P450 pathway\" GO terms indicated involvement of Arachidonic Acid (ARA) in the crosstalk mechanism. This is further confirmed by comparing the effect of ARA and coculture toward PXB-cells CYP enzymes activity. We hypothesize that some stimulus from PXB-cells resulted made iPS-derived intestine cells released ARA in form of lipoprotein, which is then taken in by PXB-cells and enhanced CYP activity.","Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder. Subtypes of MPS III are caused by deficiencies in one of four enzymes required for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). An inability to degrade HS leads to progressive neurodegeneration and death in the second or third decades of life. Knowledge of MPS III pathogenesis is incomplete, and no effective therapies exist. We generated the hypomorphic mutations sgshS387Lfs, nagluA603Efs and hgsnatG577Sfsin the endogenous zebrafish genes orthologous to human SGSH, NAGLU, and HGSNAT that are loci for mutations causing MPS III subtypes MPS IIIA, B and C respectively. Our models display the primary MPS III disease signature of significant brain accumulation of HS, while behavioural analyses support hyperactivity phenotypes. Brain transcriptome analysis revealed changes related to lysosomal, glycosaminoglycan, immune system and iron homeostasis biology in all three models but also distinct differences in brain transcriptome state between models. The transcriptome analysis also indicated marked disturbance of the oligodendrocyte cell state in the brains of MPS IIIA, B and C zebrafish, supporting that effects on this cell type are an early and consistent characteristic of MPS III. Overall, our zebrafish models recapture key characteristics of the human disease and phenotypes seen in mouse models. Our models will allow exploitation of the zebrafish’s extreme fecundity and accessible anatomy to dissect the pathological mechanisms both common and divergent between the MPS IIIA, B, and C subtypes.","Background &amp; Aims: Hypoxia in the intestinal epithelium can be caused by acute ischemic events or conditions like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) where immune cell infiltration produces ‘inflammatory hypoxia’, a chronic condition that starves the mucosa of oxygen. Epithelial regeneration after ischemia and IBD suggests intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are highly tolerant to acute and chronic hypoxia; however, the impact of acute and chronic hypoxia on human ISC (hISC) properties have not been reported. Here we present a new microphysiological system (MPS) to investigate how hypoxia affects hISCs isolated from healthy human tissues. We then test the hypothesis that some inflammation-associated interleukins protect hISCs during prolonged hypoxia.   Methods: hISCs were exposed to &lt;1.0% oxygen in the MPS for 6-, 24-, 48- &amp; 72hrs. Viability, HIF1a response, transcriptomics, cell cycle dynamics, and hISC response to cytokines were evaluated.   Results: The novel MPS enables precise, real-time control and monitoring of oxygen levels at the cell surface. Under hypoxia, hISCs maintain viability until 72hrs and exhibit peak HIF1a at 24hrs. hISCs lose stem cell activity at 24hrs that recovers at 48hrs of hypoxia. Hypoxia increases the proportion of hISCs in G1 and regulates hISC capacity to respond to multiple inflammatory signals. Hypoxia induces hISCs to upregulate many interleukin receptors and hISCs demonstrate hypoxia-dependent cell cycle regulation and increased organoid forming efficiency when treated with specific interleukins  Conclusions: Hypoxia primes hISCs to respond differently to interleukins than hISCs in normoxia through a transcriptional response. hISCs slow cell cycle progression and increase hISC activity when treated with hypoxia and specific interleukins. These findings have important implications for epithelial regeneration in the gut during inflammatory events.","Neural cells are under immense pressure to maintain proper degradation of molecules using their endo-lysosomal pathway (ELP). In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the gradual cognitive worsening of this age-related disorder is partially due to dysfunction of the ELP. However, AD is a complex disorder and how the genetic landscape eventually leads to AD is unclear. Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia (mucopolysaccharidosis type III, MPSIII) is an extreme consequence of ELP dysfunction, where inherited recessive mutations result in the inability to properly catabolise a particular polysaccharide, which ultimately accumulates and interferes with the function of the ELP. Unlike AD, Sanfilippo is genetically simple (all causative genes are identified). The primary biochemical consequences are understood and animal models of Sanfilippo are considered excellent models of the human disease. Since Sanfilippo and AD show similar pathological changes, they likely share disease-associated mechanisms. Here, we dissect the similarity between AD and Sanfilippo using RNA-seq. We have generated zebrafish knock-in models of both diseases: the early-onset familial AD-like (EOfAD-like) mutation psen1 Q96_K97del  and the MPSIII-like mutation naglu A603fs. We generated a family of zebrafish containing wild type, heterozygous EOfAD-like and homozygous MPSIII-like genotypes. We raised the family until 7 days post fertilisation and performed mRNA-seq on n = 8 induvial larvae per genotype. A power calculation revealed that this experiment was only contained ~50% power to detect differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless, changes to the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in lysosomal function could be detected in the MPS-III mutant larvae, suggesting a homeostatic response as the cells which make up the larval RNA-seq samples respond to dysfunctional lysosomes.","Exposure to titanium dioxide (TiO2) food additive by ingestion increased over the years. TiO2 is used in food to give a brighter, fresher colour to sweets, cookies, salad dressing under the name E171. New studies on E171 showed that after ingestion in a colorectal cancer mouse model, a significant increased number of colorectal tumours were found. In addition, short-term exposure to E171 induces gene expression changes in relation to oxidative stress responses, an impairment of the immune system, activation of signalling and cancer-related genes. Furthermore, dysregulation of the immune system was also observed after ingestion of E171 in rats. E171 comprises nanoparticles (NPs) and microparticles (MPs). Previous in vitro studies showed the capacity of E171, TiO2 NPs and MPs to induce oxidative stress, DNA damage, and induction of the micronuclei. The aim of our study was to investigate the relative contribution of the NPs and MPs fractions to the effects of E171 at the molecular level. This investigation was performed using in vitro exposure of Caco-2 cells to E171 as well as the NPs and MPs fractions of TiO2 and assessing effects with genome wide gene expression analysis. Results showed that the E171, TiO2 NPs and MPs induce gene expression changes in signalling, inflammation, immune system, transport, and cancer. Contribution of NPs was observed on genes involved in TLR cascade, MHC class I and II presentation, late cornified envelope, potassium channels, and cell cycle. MPs contribution was observed with changes in gene expression on a target to Hedgehog family, α-defensins, cadherin and cholinergic receptors. The gene expression changes associated with the immune system and inflammation induced by E171, MPs, and NPs suggest the creation of a favourable environment for cancer development.","Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIA is a neuropathic lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency in SGSH. Genome-wide gene expression microarrays in MPS IIIA mice detected broad molecular abnormalities (≥2 fold, FDR≤10) in numerous transcripts (314) in the brain and blood (397). Importantly, 22 dysregulated blood transcripts are known to be enriched in the brain and linked to broad neuronal functions. To target the root cause, we used a self-complementary (sc) AAVrh74 vector to deliver the human SGSH gene into 4-6-wk-old MPS IIIA mice by an intravenous injection. The treatment resulted in global CNS and widespread somatic restoration of SGSH activity, clearance of CNS and somatic GAG storage, improved behavior performance, and significantly extended survival. The scAAVrh74-hSGSH treatment also led to the correction of the majority of the transcriptional abnormalities in the brain (95.9%) and blood (97.7%), of which 182 and 290 transcripts were normalized in the brain and blood, respectively. These results demonstrate that a single systemic scAAVrh74-hSGSH delivery mediated efficient restoration of SGSH activity and resulted in a near complete correction of MPS IIIA molecular pathology. This study also demonstrates that blood transcriptional profiles reflect the biopathological status of MPS IIIA, and also respond well to effective treatments.","We generated iPSc from skin fibroblasts of two MPSIIIB patients (P1 and P2). MPSIIIB-associated cell defects were prominent in undifferentiated iPSc, in neural stem cells and in their neuronal progeny. We explored alterations of metabolic pathways in MPSIIIB neural cells by performing gene expression profiling of patient versus control neural stem cells. Exon array transcriptome analysis showed 295 transcripts with increased expression level and 1275 transcripts with decreased expression level in patient versus control neural precursors.","Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS III B) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disease of children, characterized by profound mental retardation and dementia. The primary cause is mutation in the NAGLU gene, resulting in deficiency of N-acetylglucosaminidase and lysosomal accumulation of heparan sulfate.  In the mouse model of MPS III B, neurons and microglia display the characteristic vacuolation of lysosomal storage of undegraded substrate,   but neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) display accumulation of several additional substances.  We used whole genome microarray analysis to examine differential gene expression in MEC neurons isolated by laser capture microdissection from Naglu -/- and Naglu +/- mice.  Neurons from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) were used as tissue controls.  The highest increase in gene expression (6- to 7-fold between mutant and control) in MEC and LEC neurons was that of Lyzs, which encodes lysozyme, but  accumulation of lysozyme protein was seen in MEC neurons only.   Because of a report that lysozyme induced the formation of hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) in cultured neurons, we searched for P-tau by immunohistochemistry.  P-tau was found in MEC of Naglu -/- mice, in the same neurons as lysozyme.  In older mutant mice, it was also seen in the dentate gyrus, an area important for memory.  Electron microscopy of dentate gyrus neurons showed cytoplasmic inclusions of paired helical filaments - P-tau aggregates characteristic of tauopathies, a group of age-related dementias that includes Alzheimer disease.  Our findings indicate that the Sanfilippo syndrome type B should also be considered a tauopathy.","48 hours Hypoxia","48 hours Hypoxia","48 hours Hypoxia","24 hours Hypoxia","24 hours Hypoxia","24 hours Hypoxia","24 hours Hypoxia","6 hours Hypoxia","6 hours Hypoxia","6 hours Hypoxia","48 hours Normoixa","48 hours Normoixa","48 hours Normoixa","Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder.

In vitro models of NASH play a crucial role in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and evaluating the efficacy of pharmacological interventions. Several preclinical models of MASH have been developed and are being used extensively to study these areas. While standard cell culture models allow for elucidation of certain molecular pathways involved in MASH pathogenesis, they lack three-dimensional architecture and cellular heterogeneity observed in native liver tissue, potentially limiting their physiological relevance and inability to fully capture the multifactorial nature of the disease Precision cut liver slices from MASH livers retain the complex multicellular architecture of the liver including hepatocyte arrangement, sinusoidal structure, and cellular interactions, but the metabolism deteriorates over a short period of time (usually reported as 2 days). Human liver organoids from iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells) retain the genetics of the patients but fail to fully differentiate into hepatocytes or have the liver architecture. Human liver spheroids incubated in a MASH cocktail develop several phenotypic characteristics of a MASH liver, but the small spheroid size precludes extensive histological comparisons to MASH livers. Microphysiological systems (MPS) or “liver on a chip” in which 3D cultures are perfused, maintain many of the physiological functions of the liver owing to precise control over microenvironmental parameters, including fluid flow, nutrient gradients, and mechanical cues. However, MPS are difficult to scale up and have not been developed to reproduce a MASH phenotype.  In comparison, bioprinted liver tissues for MASH have many advantages. Organovo’s 3D bioprinted liver tissues are comprised of all major primary liver cells including hepatocytes, endothelial cells, stellates and Kupffer cells, mixed in physiologically relevant ratios. These cells are then bioprinted in precise pre-defined liver specific geometries to recapitulate complexity of the hepatic microenvironment.. This mimicking of tissue architecture enables more accurate representation of cellular interactions, spatial organization, and microenvironmental cues crucial for MASH pathogenesis. The liver tissues developed using this method maintain differentiation and metabolism over several weeks. In this paper, we further demonstrated that upon treatment with a MASH induction cocktail, these liver tissues respond accurately by developing steatosis and fibrosis Tissue response varies depending in response to the complexity of the MASH cocktail.","Adult skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells (SCs), are widely believed to be responsible for muscle regeneration, which is regulated by complex networks of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Emerging evidence demonstrates extrinsic regulations from other cell types can significantly impact the regeneration process, especially in repetitive cycles of degeneration/regeneration environment. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor (TF) Yin Yang 1 (YY1) deletion in MuSCs of mdx mouse induces CCL5 expression by alleviating the repressive effect on 3D structural interactions on Ccl5 locus. This leads to the increased secretion of CCL5 from MuSCs to the muscle niche, which promotes the recruitment of macrophages (MPs) through the CCL5/CCR5 axis. Incremental MPs lead to continuous inflammation that promotes the survival of Fibro-adipogenic progenitors’ (FAP) through secreting elevated TGFβ1 to stimulate FAPs resisting apoptosis, resulting in aggravated dystrophic pathology manifested by exacerbated fibrosis. Inhibition of CCL5/CCR5 axis by Maraviroc injection effectively mitigates muscle dystrophy and enhances muscle performance in YY1 deletion mdx mouse. Altogether, our findings promote us to conclude that YY1 functions as a 3D structural protein to repress Ccl5 production at the transcriptional level in MuSCs, playing a critical role in orchestrating MuSC/MP/FAP crosstalk through CCL5/CCR5 and TGFβ1 signaling. Intrinsic deletion of YY1 in MuSCs disrupts the cellular interactions and leads to skewed muscle niche with aggravated muscle dystrophy upon chronic injury.","Adult skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells (SCs), are widely believed to be responsible for muscle regeneration, which is regulated by complex networks of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

Dysregulation in the epidermal differentiation process contributes to barrier dysfunction and is implicated in the pathology of various dermatological diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate (MPS) is used as a moisturizing agent for xerosis in AD patients. However, its mechanism of action on keratinocytes, the main constituent of the epidermis, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of MPS on keratinocytes by subjecting adult human epidermal keratinocyte (HEKa) cells and three-dimensional cultured keratinocytes to MPS treatment, followed by transcriptome analysis. The analysis revealed that MPS treatment enhances keratinocyte differentiation and suppresses proliferation. We focused on amphiregulin (AREG), a membrane protein that belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and possesses a heparin-binding domain, as a significant target of the MPS among the genes altered by MPS. It is revealed that MPS exerts an inhibitory effect directly on AREG, rather than on the EGF receptor or other members of the EGF family. Furthermore, it is suggested that AREG leads to a reduction in epidermal barrier function, whereas MPS contributes to barrier enhancement through AREG inhibition. Collectively, these findings suggest that MPS modulates barrier function through the inhibition of AREG, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for skin barrier restoration.","The advent of micro-physiological systems (MPS) in biomedical research has enabled the introduction of more complex and relevant physiological into in vitro models. The recreation of complex morphological features in three-dimensional environments can recapitulate otherwise absent dynamic interactions in conventional models. In this study we developed an advanced in vitro Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) that mimics the interplay between healthy and malignant renal tissue. Based on the TissUse Humimic platform our model combines healthy renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) and RCC. Co-culturing reconstructed RPTEC tubules with RCC spheroids in a closed micro-perfused circuit resulted in significant phenotypical changes to the tubules. Expression of immune factors revealed that interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α) were upregulated in the non-malignant cells while neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was downregulated in both RCC and RPTEC. Metabolic analysis revealed that RCC prompted a shift in the energy production of RPTEC tubules, inducing glycolysis, in a metabolic adaptation that likely supports RCC growth and immunogenicity. In contrast, RCC maintained stable metabolic activity, emphasizing their resilience to external factors. RNA-seq and biological process analysis of primary RTPTEC tubules demonstrated that the 3D tubular architecture and MPS conditions reverted cells to a predominant oxidative phosphorylate state, a departure from the glycolytic metabolism observed in 2D culture. This dynamic RCC co-culture model, approximates the physiology of healthy renal tubules to that of RCC, providing new insights into tumor-host interactions. Our approach can show that an RCC-MPS can expand the complexity and scope of pathophysiology and biomarker studies in kidney cancer research.","Classical methods of investigating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are generally performed in non-living systems, yet in recent years new technologies utilizing proximity labeling (PL) have given researchers the tools to explore proximal PPIs in living systems. PL has distinct advantages over traditional protein interactome studies, such as the ability to identify weak and transient interactions in vitro and in vivo. Most PL studies are performed on targets within or on the cell membrane. We have adapted the original PL method to investigate PPIs within the extracellular compartment, using both BioID2 and TurboID, that we term extracellular PL (ePL). To demonstrate the utility of this modified technique, we investigate the interactome of the widely expressed matrisome protein Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2). Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are a family of multi-functional proteins that were initially defined by their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of metalloproteinases (MPs), the major mediators of extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown and turnover. TIMP2 exhibits a broad expression profile and is often abundant in both normal and diseased tissues. Understanding the functional transformation of matrisome regulators, like TIMP2, during the evolution of tissue microenvironments associated with disease progression is essential for the development of ECM targeted therapeutics. Using carboxyl- and amino-terminal fusion proteins of TIMP2 with BioID2 and TurboID, we describe the TIMP2 proximal interactome. We also illustrate how the TIMP2 interactome changes in the presence of different stimuli, in different cell types, in unique culture conditions (2D vs 3D), and with different reaction kinetics (BioID2 vs. TurboID); demonstrating the power of this technique versus classical PPI methods. We propose that the screening of matrisome targets in disease models using ePL will reveal new therapeutic targets for further comprehensive studies.","Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder. Subtypes of MPS III are caused by deficiencies in one of four enzymes required for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). An inability to degrade HS leads to progressive neurodegeneration and death in the second or third decades of life. Knowledge of MPS III pathogenesis is incomplete, and no effective therapies exist. We generated the hypomorphic mutations sgshS387Lfs, nagluA603Efs and hgsnatG577Sfsin the endogenous zebrafish genes orthologous to human SGSH, NAGLU, and HGSNAT that are loci for mutations causing MPS III subtypes MPS IIIA, B and C respectively. Our models display the primary MPS III disease signature of significant brain accumulation of HS, while behavioural analyses support hyperactivity phenotypes. Brain transcriptome analysis revealed changes related to lysosomal, glycosaminoglycan, immune system and iron homeostasis biology in all three models but also distinct differences in brain transcriptome state between models. The transcriptome analysis also indicated marked disturbance of the oligodendrocyte cell state in the brains of MPS IIIA, B and C zebrafish, supporting that effects on this cell type are an early and consistent characteristic of MPS III. Overall, our zebrafish models recapture key characteristics of the human disease and phenotypes seen in mouse models. Our models will allow exploitation of the zebrafish’s extreme fecundity and accessible anatomy to dissect the pathological mechanisms both common and divergent between the MPS IIIA, B, and C subtypes.","Chronic white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation has been recognized as a critical early event in the pathogenesis of obesity-related disorders. This process is characterized by the increased residency of proinflammatory M1 macrophages in WAT. However, the lack of an isogenic human macrophage-adipocyte model has limited biological studies and drug discovery efforts, highlighting the need for human stem cell-based approaches. Here, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived macrophages (iMACs) and adipocytes (iADIPOs) are cocultured in a microphysiological system (MPS). iMACs migrate toward and infiltrate into the 3D iADIPOs cluster to form crown-like structures (CLSs)-like morphology around damaged iADIPOs, recreating classic histological features of WAT inflammation seen in obesity. Significantly more CLS-like morphologies formed in aged and palmitic acid-treated iMAC-iADIPO-MPS, showing the ability to mimic inflammatory severity. Importantly, M1 (proinflammatory) but not M2 (tissue repair) iMACs induced insulin resistance and dysregulated lipolysis in iADIPOs. Both RNAseq and cytokines analyses revealed a reciprocal proinflammatory loop in the interactions of M1 iMACs and iADIPOs. Our iMAC-iADIPO-MPS thus successfully recreates pathological conditions of chronically inflamed human WAT, allowing us to study the dynamic inflammatory progression and identify clinically relevant therapies.","Neural cells are under immense pressure to maintain proper degradation of molecules using their endo-lysosomal pathway (ELP). In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the gradual cognitive worsening of this age-related disorder is partially due to dysfunction of the ELP. However, AD is a complex disorder and how the genetic landscape eventually leads to AD is unclear. Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia (mucopolysaccharidosis type III, MPSIII) is an extreme consequence of ELP dysfunction, where inherited recessive mutations result in the inability to properly catabolise a particular polysaccharide, which ultimately accumulates and interferes with the function of the ELP. Unlike AD, Sanfilippo is genetically simple (all causative genes are identified). The primary biochemical consequences are understood and animal models of Sanfilippo are considered excellent models of the human disease. Since Sanfilippo and AD show similar pathological changes, they likely share disease-associated mechanisms. Here, we dissect the similarity between AD and Sanfilippo using RNA-seq. We have generated zebrafish knock-in models of both diseases: the early-onset familial AD-like (EOfAD-like) mutation psen1 Q96_K97del  and the MPSIII-like mutation naglu A603fs. We generated a family of zebrafish containing wild type, heterozygous EOfAD-like and homozygous MPSIII-like genotypes. We raised the family until 7 days post fertilisation and performed mRNA-seq on n = 8 induvial larvae per genotype. A power calculation revealed that this experiment was only contained ~50% power to detect differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless, changes to the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in lysosomal function could be detected in the MPS-III mutant larvae, suggesting a homeostatic response as the cells which make up the larval RNA-seq samples respond to dysfunctional lysosomes.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Proteinuria, the spillage of serum proteins into the urine, is a feature of glomerulonephritides, podocyte disorders and diabetic nephropathy. However, the response of tubular epithelial cells to serum protein exposure has not been systematically characterized. Using transcriptomic profiling we studied serum-induced changes in primary human tubular epithelial cells cultured in 3D microphysiological devices. Serum proteins induced cellular proliferation, secretion of cytokines and activated a coordinated stress response. We orthogonally confirmed our findings by comparing the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of. Importantly, key transcriptomic programs in response to serum exposure remained consistent when comparing intact renal cortex to primary human tubules cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum and to an established mouse model of kidney injury. This serum-induced transcriptional response was dominated by AP-1 and NFkB signatures in the tubular epigenomic landscape with features of active regulation at canonical kidney injury genes (HAVCR1) and genes associated with COVID-19 (ACE2, IL6). Our data provide a reference map for dissecting the regulatory and transcriptional response of tubular epithelial cells to serum-induced injury.","Proteinuria, the spillage of serum proteins into the urine, is a feature of glomerulonephritides, podocyte disorders and diabetic nephropathy.

Especially, severe nephrotoxicity is of great concern, as characterized by degeneration of epithelial cells of the proximal tubules and interstitial fibrosis.  However, its mechanism of toxicity, hazard identification as well as genetic risk factors contributing to OTA toxicity in humans has been elusive due to the lack of adequate models that fully recapitulate kidney function in vitro.  The present study attempts to evaluate dose-response relationships, identify the contribution of active transport proteins that govern renal disposition of OTA, and determine the role of metabolism in bioactivation and detoxification of OTA using a 3D human kidney proximal tubule microphysiological system (kidney MPS).  We demonstrated that IC50 values of OTA in kidney MPS culture (0.375 – 1.21 µM) were in good agreement with clinical toxic concentrations of OTA in urine.  Surprisingly, no enhancement of kidney injury biomarkers was evident in the effluents of kidney MPS after OTA exposure despite significant toxicity observed by LIVE/DEAD staining, rather these biomarkers were decreased in OTA concentration-dependent manner.   Furthermore, the effect of 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) and 6-(NBD-4-ylthio-) hexanol (NBDHEX), pan-inhibitor of P450 and GST enzymes, respectively, on the OTA-induced toxicity in kidney MPS was examined, which resulted in significant enhancement of OTA-induced toxicity by NBDHEX  (3 µM) treatment whereas ABT (1 mM) treatment decreased OTA-induced toxicity, suggesting the roles of GSTs and P450 enzymes in the detoxification and bioactivation of OTA, respectively.  Additionally, OTA transport studies using kidney MPS in the presence and absence of inhibitor of organic anion transporter(s), probenecid (1 mM), revealed the role of organic anionic membrane transporter(s) in the kidney specific disposition of OTA.  Our findings provide a better understanding of the mechanism of OTA-induced kidney injury which may support changes in risk assessment, regulatory agency policies on allowable exposure levels and determination of genetic factors in high-risk populations against OTA nephrotoxicity.","Drug-induced kidney injury, largely caused by proximal tubular intoxicants, limits development and clinical use of new and approved drugs. Assessing preclinical nephrotoxicity relies on animal models that are frequently insensitive, and thus, novel techniques, including human microphysiological systems, or “organs on chips,” are proposed to accelerate drug development and predict safety. Polymyxins are potent antibiotics against multidrug-resistant microorganisms; yet clinical use remains restricted because of high risk of nephrotoxicity and limited understanding of toxicological mechanisms. To mitigate risks, structural analogs of polymyxins (NAB739 and NAB741) are currently in clinical development. Using a microphysiological system to model human kidney proximal tubule, we exposed cells to polymyxin B (PMB) and observed significant increases of injury signals, including kidney injury molecule-1 KIM-1and a panel of injury-associated miRNAs (each P &lt; 0.001). Surprisingly, transcriptional profiling identified cholesterol biosynthesis as the primary cellular pathway induced by PMB (P = 1.2 ×10–16), and effluent cholesterol concentrations were significantly increased after exposure (P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, we observed no upregulation of the nuclear factor (erythroid derived-2)–like 2 pathway despite this being a common pathway upregulated in response to proximal tubule toxicants. In contrast with PMB exposure, minimal changes in gene expression, injury biomarkers, and cholesterol concentrations were observed in response to NAB739 and NAB741. Our findings demonstrate the preclinical safety of NAB739 and  NAB741 and reveal cholesterol biosynthesis as the novel (to our knowledge) pathway for PMB- induced injury. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a human-on-chip platform used  for simultaneous safety testing of new chemical entities and defining unique toxicological pathway responses of an FDA-approved molecule.","We generated iPSc from skin fibroblasts of two MPSIIIB patients (P1 and P2). MPSIIIB-associated cell defects were prominent in undifferentiated iPSc, in neural stem cells and in their neuronal progeny. We explored alterations of metabolic pathways in MPSIIIB neural cells by performing gene expression profiling of patient versus control neural stem cells. Exon array transcriptome analysis showed 295 transcripts with increased expression level and 1275 transcripts with decreased expression level in patient versus control neural precursors.","Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS III B) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disease of children, characterized by profound mental retardation and dementia. The primary cause is mutation in the NAGLU gene, resulting in deficiency of N-acetylglucosaminidase and lysosomal accumulation of heparan sulfate.  In the mouse model of MPS III B, neurons and microglia display the characteristic vacuolation of lysosomal storage of undegraded substrate,   but neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) display accumulation of several additional substances.  We used whole genome microarray analysis to examine differential gene expression in MEC neurons isolated by laser capture microdissection from Naglu -/- and Naglu +/- mice.  Neurons from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) were used as tissue controls.  The highest increase in gene expression (6- to 7-fold between mutant and control) in MEC and LEC neurons was that of Lyzs, which encodes lysozyme, but  accumulation of lysozyme protein was seen in MEC neurons only.   Because of a report that lysozyme induced the formation of hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) in cultured neurons, we searched for P-tau by immunohistochemistry.  P-tau was found in MEC of Naglu -/- mice, in the same neurons as lysozyme.  In older mutant mice, it was also seen in the dentate gyrus, an area important for memory.  Electron microscopy of dentate gyrus neurons showed cytoplasmic inclusions of paired helical filaments - P-tau aggregates characteristic of tauopathies, a group of age-related dementias that includes Alzheimer disease.  Our findings indicate that the Sanfilippo syndrome type B should also be considered a tauopathy.","Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html  June 03, 2009: annotation table updated with netaffx build 28 June 06, 2012: annotation table updated with netaffx build 32 June 23, 2016: annotation table updated with netaffx build 35 Protocol: see manufacturer's web site  Complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set plus 6,500 additional genes for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.

","HEKa","Natural killer (NK) cells play an integral role in immunosurveillance against myeloid malignancies, with their mature phenotype and abundance linked to prolonged treatment-free remission in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, NK cell function is suppressed during the disease, and the orchestrators of this impairment are not fully understood. Using a chimeric BCR::ABL1+ CML mouse model, we characterized the impact of the leukemic microenvironment on NK cell function and gene transcription. To address the latter, we profiled NK cells from spleen and bone marrow of CML and healthy mice by single-cell RNA sequencing. We revealed an inflammatory cytokine response in CML-exposed NK cells, highlighted by the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa)-induced gene signature, upregulation of TNFa receptor TNFR2, and enrichment of SOCS family genes such as Cish, the critical NK cell checkpoint. Ex vivo exposure of healthy NK cells to leukemic soluble factors compromised target-specific NK cell degranulation, which was partially rescued by inhibiting Cish or TNFa - candidate targets reveiled by scRNA-seq. In alignment with these findings, NK cells from healthy donors displayed suppressed cytotoxicity when exposed to plasma from untreated CML patients, with a partial restoration upon Cish or TNFa inhibition. Furthermore, NK cells from newly diagnosed CML patients pre-destined for blast crisis showed an enrichment of the TNFa-induced pro-inflammatory gene signature identified in CML mice. These results suggest that targeting inflammatory signaling could enhance NK cell-based immunotherapies for CML.","The transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) is a master regulator of myelopoiesis. CEBPA encodes a long (p42) and a truncated (p30) protein isoform from a single mRNA. Mutations that abnormally enhance expression of p30 are associated with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We show by mutational analysis that three highly conserved arginine residues (R140,147,154) located at the p30 C/EBPα N-terminus, previously found to be methylated, are involved in myeloid lineage commitment, progenitor proliferation, and differentiation. The conservative amino acid substitution with lysine that retains the amino acid side chain charge enhanced progenitor proliferation, while a non-conservative substitution with uncharged side chains (alanine or leucine) impaired proliferation and enhanced granulopoietic differentiation. Analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) suggested that arginine methylation of p30 C/EBPα differentially determines its capacity to interact with SWI/SNF and MLL complexes. Pharmacological targeting of p30 C/EBPα arginine methylation may have clinical relevance in myeloproliferative and inflammatory diseases, in neutropenia, and in leukemic stem cells.","the molecular mechanisms behind the turnover of medullry thymic epithelial cells remain unclear.  We performeds single cell RNA-seq of TECs from mice 15 days after depleting cytokine RANKL and CD40L signaling.","Background In the ongoing battle against BCR-ABL+ leukemia, despite significant advances with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the persistent challenges of drug resistance and the enduring presence of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) remain formidable barriers to achieving a cure.  Methods In this study, we demonstrated that Disulfiram (DSF) induces ferroptosis to synergize with TKIs in inhibiting BCR-ABL+ cells, particularly targeting resistant cells and LSCs, using cell models, mouse models, and primary cells from patients. We elucidated the mechanism by which DSF promotes GPX4 degradation to induce ferroptosis through immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), RNA sequencing, lipid peroxidation assays, and rescue experiments. Results Here, we present compelling evidence elucidating the sensitivity of DSF, an FDA-approved drug for alcohol dependence, towards BCR-ABL+ cells. Our findings underscore DSF's ability to selectively induce a potent cytotoxic effect on BCR-ABL+ cell lines and effectively inhibit primary BCR-ABL+ leukemia cells. Crucially, the combined treatment of DSF with TKIs selectively eradicates TKI-insensitive stem cells and resistant cells. Of particular note is DSF's capacity to disrupt GPX4 stability, elevate the labile iron pool, and intensify lipid peroxidation, ultimately leading to ferroptotic cell death. Our investigation shows that BCR-ABL expression induces alterations in cellular iron metabolism and increases GPX4 expression. Additionally, we demonstrate the indispensability of GPX4 for LSC development and the initiation/maintenance of BCR-ABL+ leukemia. Mechanical analysis further elucidates DSF's ability to circumvent resistance by reducing GPX4 levels through the disruption of its binding with HSPA8, thereby promoting GPX4 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Furthermore, the combined treatment of DSF with TKIs effectively targets both BCR-ABL+ blast cells and drug-insensitive LSCs, conferring a significant survival advantage in mouse models. Conclusion In summary, the dual inhibition of GPX4 and BCR-ABL presents a promising therapeutic strategy to synergistically target blast cells and drug-insensitive LSCs in patients, offering potential avenues for advancing leukemia treatment.","During wounding healing, different pools of stem cells (SCs) During homeostasis, different compartments of the epidermis are sustained by distinct pools of stem cells (SC) whereas, upon wounding, these different SCs contribute to skin repair. However, how SCs become activated and drive the tissue remodeling essential for skin repair is still poorly understood. Here, by developing a mouse model allowing lineage tracing and basal cell lineage ablation while leaving the basic organization of the skin intact, we monitor SC fate and tissue dynamics during regeneration using confocal and intravital imaging. Analysis of basal cell rearrangements shows dynamic transitions from a solid-like homeostatic state to a fluid-like state allowing tissue remodelling during repair, as predicted by a minimal mathematical modelling of the spatiotemporal dynamics and fate behaviour of the basal cells population. The basal cell layer progressively returns to a solid-like state with re-epithelialization and the restoration of barrier function. Bulk, single-cell RNA and epigenetic profiling of SCs together with functional experiments uncover a common regenerative state regulated by the EGFR/AP1 axis activated during tissue fluidization that is essential for skin SC activation and tissue repair.","During wounding healing, different pools of stem cells (SCs) During homeostasis, different compartments of the epidermis are sustained by distinct pools of stem cells (SC) whereas, upon wounding, these different SCs contribute to skin repair.

Then to understand the underlying mechanisms of S1PR1-dependent stemness maintenance, we performed gene expression profiling analyses comparing CD34+S1PR1+ and CD34+S1PR1- cell fractions from AML patients and healthy donors; we also determined the global transcriptional response of KG1 cells to an inhibitor of S1PR1 (FTY720) at two concentrations.","Inhibiting EZH2 using tazemetostat led to induction of lineage-specific genes","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","EZH2 has differential activity in prostate adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine prostate cancer.","In developing B cells, V(D)J gene recombination is initiated by the RAG1/2 endonuclease complex, introducing double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in V, D and J genes and resulting in the formation of the hypervariable parts of immunoglobulins (Ig). Persistent or aberrant RAG1/2 targeting is a potential threat to genome integrity. While RAG1 and RAG2 have been shown to bind various regions genome-wide, the in vivo off-target DNA damage instigated by RAG1/2 endonuclease remains less well understood. In the current study, we identified regions containing RAG1/2-induced DNA breaks in mouse pre-B cells on a genome-wide scale using a global DNA DSB detection strategy. Around 1500 putative RAG1/2-dependent DSBs were identified, most of which were located outside the Ig loci. DNA sequence motif analysis showed a specific enrichment of RAG1/2-induced DNA DSBs at GA- and CA-repeats and at GC-rich motifs. These findings provide further insights into RAG1/2 off-target activity. The ability of RAG1/2 to introduce DSBs on the non-Ig loci during the endogenous V(D)J recombination emphasizes its genotoxic potential in developing lymphocytes.","The aim of this experiment was to study the DNA interaction of a kinase-dead mutant of the cell cycle kinase CDK6 (CDK6-K43M) in a murine model of BCR-ABL driven leukemia.","We aimed to analyze the transcriptomic changes in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells induced by anti-PD-1 treatment and/or anti-PD-L1x4-1BB bispecific antibody treatment","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","In developing B lymphocytes, V(D)J recombination assembles IgH and Igk variable region exons from hundreds of gene segments clustered across mega-base Igh and Igk loci. V, D, and J segments are flanked by conserved recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that target RAG endonuclease. RAG orchestrates Igh V(D)J recombination upon capturing a JH-RSS within the JH-RSS-based recombination center (RC). JH-RSS orientation programs RAG to scan upstream D- and VH-containing chromatin linearly presented by cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. During Igh scanning, RAG robustly utilizes only D- or VH-RSSs in convergent (\"deletional\") orientation with JH-RSSs. However, for Vk-to-Jk joining, RAG utilizes Vk-RSSs from deletional- and inversional-oriented clusters, inconsistent with linear scanning. Here, we elucidate the Vk-to-Jk joining mechanism. Igk undergoes robust primary and secondary rearrangements, which confounds scanning assays. Thus, we engineered cells to undergo only primary Vk-to-Jk rearrangements and found that RAG-scanning from the primary Jk-RC terminates just 8kb upstream within the CTCF-Site-based Sis element. While Sis and the Jk-RC barely interacted with the Vk locus, the CTCF-site-based Cer element, 4kb upstream of Sis, interacted with various loop-extrusion impediments across the locus.  Like VH-locus inversion, DJH inversion abrogated VH-to-DJH joining; yet Vk-locus or Jk inversion allowed robust Vk-to-Jk joining. Together, these experiments implicated loop extrusion in bringing Vks near Cer for short-range diffusion-mediated capture by RC-based RAG. To elucidate key mechanistic elements for diffusional V(D)J recombination in Igk versus Igh, we assayed Vk-to-JH and D-to-Jk rearrangements in hybrid Igh-Igk loci generated by targeted chromosomal translocations, and pinpointed remarkably strong Vk and Jk RSSs. Indeed, RSS replacements in hybrid or normal Igk and Igh loci confirmed ability of Igk versus Igh RSSs to promote robust diffusional joining. We propose that Igk evolved strong RSSs to mediate diffusional Vk-to-Jk joining; while Igh evolved weaker RSSs requisite for modulating VH joining by RAG scanning impediments.","In developing B lymphocytes, V(D)J recombination assembles IgH and Igk variable region exons from hundreds of gene segments clustered across mega-base Igh and Igk loci.

Results of this analysis showed impaired astro- and neurogenesis in both types of organoids (unguided and cortical), including a lack of cells acquiring the astrocyte fate, and an increased abundance of cells differentiating into lineages other than neuroectodermal. The results also suggested dysregulation of extracellular matrix, membrane, and cytoskeleton components, which might have also affected their differentiation trajectories.","Co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes derived from human iPS cells carrying a GFAP (R239C) mutation - an identified cause of Alexander disease (AxD) - were analyzed with single-cell RNA sequencing to assess cell population composition, differential gene expression, and cell-cell interaction differences in AxD co-cultures compared to controls. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) challenge was applied to identify differences in stress response. Our results suggested differentiation impairment especially in AxD astrocytes, represented by an enriched population of less differentiated cells and downregulation of mature astrocyte genes in AxD astrocytes-containing co-cultures. Furthermore, AxD co-cultures showed increased stress response represented by upregulation of metallothioneins and increased susceptibility to the OGD challenge.","We observed that T cells from patients with blast crisis (BC) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) lacked miR-142 and were fewer and exhausted compared with those from patients with chronic phase (CP) CML. Accordingly, the BC Mir142−/−BCR/ABL mouse also presented with T lymphopenia compared with the CP Mir142+/+BCR/ABL mouse. The miR-142 deficit impaired thymic differentiation of lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPP) into mature T cells and redirected them toward myeloid lineage. The fewer mature T cells that emerged from LMPP differentiation in the BC mouse were enriched with exhausted T effectors. Leukemic blasts-secreted inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6) mediated the miR-142 deficit, which in turn prevented the metabolic reprogramming that allows activated T cells to thrive and expand and promoted expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1. Thus, loss of miR-142 expression ultimately resulted in BC immune escape and disease growth. In fact, immunodeficient mice transplanted with BC CML LSKs and miR-142 KO T cells had shorter survival than those transplanted with BC CML LSKs and miR-142 wild-type T cells. Conversely, BC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice receiving autologous T cells and synthetic miR-142 mimic lived longer than those receiving autologous T cells and scramble RNA. Combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) plus synthetic miR-142 and/or PD-1 antibody induced a prolonged survival compared to TKI alone, suggesting that harnessing the host immune system with synthetic miR-142 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for BC CML.","Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread reproductive disorder with hyperandrogenemia and impaired follicular development. Granulosa cells (GC) and thecal cells (TC) are crucial during follicular development, but their responses to androgen remain poorly understood at subpopulation levels. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed GC and TC subpopulations in Dehydroepiandrosterone-induced PCOS-like mice to determine the ovarian microenvironment characters. We observed gene expression changes in steroidogenesis and cell-cell communications, with significant landscape shifts in subtypes. GC subsets showed an inflammatory GC5 expansion and loss of luteinized GC7, while TC subsets exhibited an increased TC2 population with enhanced lipid metabolism and androgen response. Intercellular signaling was heightened, particularly with amplified ligand-receptor interactions for Ptn-Ncl and Mdk-Ncl. Steroidogenesis was altered for PCOS's steroid hormone abnormalities. These findings revealed androgen impact in the cell subpopulations of follicular microenvironment and underscored the importance of Ptn-Ncl and Mdk-Ncl in PCOS-associated impaired follicular development.","Cardiac arrhythmias stemming from abnormal sinoatrial node (SAN) function can lead to sudden death. Developing a biological pacemaker device for treating sick sinus syndrome (SSS) could offer a potential cure. Understanding SAN differentiation is crucial, yet its regulatory mechanism remains unclear. We reanalyzed published RNA-seq data and identified Odz4 as a SAN-specific candidate. In situ hybridization revealed Odz4 expression in the cardiac crescent and throughout the cardiac conduction system (CCS). To assess role of Odz4 in CCS differentiation, we utilized a Tet-Off inducible system for its intracellular domain (ICD). Odz4-ICD exogenously expressing embryonic bodies (EBs) exhibited an increased propensity to develop into pacemaker-like cells with enhanced automaticity and upregulated expression of SAN-specific genes. CellChat and GO analyses unveiled SAN-specific enrichment of ligand-receptor sets, especially Ptn-Ncl, and extracellular matrix components in the Odz4-ICD exogenously expressing group.

However, in order to gain comprehensive understanding of a drug response, a prediction model should reflect the underlying biological mechanisms, but the current models suffer from interpretability and scalability problems. Machine learning-based prediction models base their predictions on inferred features, which usually are not well correlated with biological mechanisms, posing a challenge on interpretability of its response predictions. In this regard, using Boolean modeling schemes may allow interpretations on mechanisms that contribute to a particular response, but optimizing Boolean models is difficult because of their high dimensional search space and discontinuous loss function. Here, we developed a scalable derivative-free optimizer for weighted sum Boolean network through meta-reinforcement learning. By using graph network and coordinate-wise policy, our learned optimizer can optimize high dimensional Boolean networks containing over 100 parameters of arbitrary structure, showing higher sample efficiency compared with other meta-heuristic algorithms. The optimized Boolean networks successfully predict the drug responses congruent with public databases and in-house experimental data. Moreover, mechanistic analysis of optimized networks shows reliable interpretability of the predictions by meaningful suggestions of known basket trial drug response prediction markers.","Normalization of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for gene expression comparison is essential to ensure accurate gene expression quantification. It has been argued that samples with large differences in global expression level cannot be properly normalized without spike-in control RNAs, however, spike-in controls are expensive and not yet widely used. Here, we presented a spike-in independent quantitative RNA sequencing (siqRNA-seq) method, which uses reads from genome DNA as an internal reference to quantify gene expression level. We showed that siqRNA-seq profiles gene expression as traditional RNA-seq, but allows to identify different expression genes between samples with distinct mRNA content. We also showed siqRNA-seq enable us to assess the copy number of mRNA per cell without counting cells and adding spike-ins. Thus, siqRNA-seq provides a convenient and versatile means to quantitatively profile the mRNA landscape in cells.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Using single-cell RNA-seq of colon lamina propria leukocytes (LPL), together with ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq from colon LPL and sorted CD4+ T from colon lamina propria during oral infection with the pathobiont Helicobacter hepaticus we show that Blimp-1 and c-Maf both positively regulate Il10 gene expression, but also cooperate to negatively regulate a large network of proinflammatory effector genes in T cells. While T cell-specific deletion of either Prdm1, Maf or both transcription factors did not result in overt inflammation of the colon at steady state, H. hepaticus infection resulted in mild/moderate colitis in both the Prdm1fl/flCd4Cre and Maffl/flCd4Cre single T cell-specific transcription factor deficient mice, while the double knockout Prdm1fl/flMaffl/flCd4Cre infected mice suffered severe colitis and showed a massive increase in T cell effector genes in colonic LPL. Blimp-1 and c-Maf cooperate to negatively regulate genes including Ifng, Csf2, Il23r, Stat4, Il18r1 and Il2rg, and deletion of both these transcription factors in T cells translated to an exacerbated pathogenic TH1, IFN-g+GM-CSF+ effector cell response. c-Maf, additionally negatively regulated Il17a expression which was elevated in the LPL as assessed by bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-Seq analysis in the H. hepaticus infected Maffl/flCd4Cre mice.","Using single-cell RNA-seq of colon lamina propria leukocytes (LPL), together with ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq from colon LPL and sorted CD4+ T from colon lamina propria during oral infection with the pathobiont Helicobacter hepaticus we show that Blimp-1 and c-Maf both positively regulate Il10 gene expression, but also cooperate to negatively regulate a large network of proinflammatory effector genes in T cells.

To explore the contribution of circulating monocytes to the microvascular lesions, high-throughput RNA sequencing was conducted and we found high-level expression of cathepsin D (CTSD) in the monocytes of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. The transgenic mice expressing human CTSD in the monocytes showed increased brain microvascular permeability resembling the diabetic microvascular phenotype, accompanied with cognitive deficit. Mechanistically, we found the monocytes release non-enzymatic pro-CTSD to upregulate caveolin expression in brain endothelium triggering caveolae-mediated transcytosis, without affecting the paracellular route of brain microvasculature. The circulating pro-CTSD activated the caveolae-mediated transcytosis in brain endothelial cells via its binding with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). Importantly, genetic ablation of CTSD in the monocytes exhibited protective effect against the diabetes-enhanced brain microvascular transcytosis and the diabetes-induced cognitive impairment. Our findings thus uncover the novel role of circulatory pro-CTSD from monocytes in the pathogenesis of cerebral microvascular lesions in diabetes. The circulatory pro-CTSD is thus a potential target for the intervention of microvascular complications in diabetes.","Despite the well-characterized protein network involved in replication stress response, several regulatory RNAs have been shown to be involved in this process; however, it has remained elusive the presence of such RNAs on the replication fork, and how they locally act in this critical process. Here, we identified lncREST, a previously uncharacterized lncRNA among a set of chromatin-associated transcripts induced by hydroxyurea. We show that lncREST localizes on stressed replication forks. Specifically, during replication stress, lncREST interacts with NCL in the nucleus, to help engage its interaction with RPA. Consequently, lncREST loss is associated to reduction of NCL-RPA interaction and decreased RPA on chromatin, leading to a defective replication stress signaling. lncREST depleted cells suffer sustained replication fork progression and accumulate un-signaled DNA damage. These findings uncover a structural function of a lncRNA acting as anchoring point for replication proteins foci on sites of DNA replication.","Despite the well-characterized protein network involved in replication stress response, several regulatory RNAs have been shown to be involved in this process; however, it has remained elusive the presence of such RNAs on the replication fork, and how they locally act in this critical process.

Genetic deletion of Rxrg didn’t impact ILC2 development, but significantly facilitated ILC2 responses and type 2 inflammation induced by IL-25 or helminths. RXRγ maintained the expression of its target genes that support cholesterol efflux in ILC2s. Chemical inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase rescued the abnormal responses of RXRγ-deficient ILC2s. Furthermore, RXRγ expression in ILC2s protected the host from the intestinal mastocytosis induced by skin injury. We propose that the dynamic regulation of RXRγ expression and it mediated genomic states functions as a cell-intrinsic circuit to determine ILC2 reactivity in the small intestine.","The role of HIF1a-glycolysis in regulating IFN-g induction in hypoxic T cells is unknown. Given that hypoxia is a common feature in a wide array of pathophysiological contexts such as tumor and that IFN-g is instrumental for protective immunity, it is of great significance to gain a clear idea on this. Combining pharmacological and genetic gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we find that HIF1a-glycolysis controls IFN-g induction in both human and mouse T cells activated under hypoxia. Specific deletion of HIF1a in T cells (HIF1a–/–) and glycolytic inhibition significantly abrogate IFN-g induction. Conversely, HIF1a stabilization in T cells by hypoxia and VHL deletion (VHL–/–) promotes IFN-g production. Mechanistically, reduced IFN-g production in hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells is due to attenuated activation-induced cell death but not proliferative defect. We further show that depletion of intracellular acetyl-CoA  is a key metabolic underlying mechanism. Hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells are less able to kill tumor cells, and HIF1a–/– tumor-bearing mice are not responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, indicating loss of HIF1a in T cells is a major mechanism of therapeutic resistance to ICBs. Importantly, acetate supplementation restores IFN-g production in hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells and re-sensitizes HIF1a–/– tumor-bearing mice to ICBs, providing an effective strategy to overcome ICB resistance. Taken together, our results highlight T cell HIF1a-anaerobic glycolysis as a principal mediator of IFN-g induction and anti-tumor immunity. Considering that acetate supplementation (i.e., glycerol triacetate (GTA)) is approved to treat infants with Canavan disease, we envision a rapid translation of our findings, justifying further testing of GTA as a repurposed medicine for ICB resistance, a pressing unmet medical need","When the structural stability of a protein is compromised, the protein may form non-native interactions with other cell proteins and thus becomes a hazard to the cell. To mitigate this danger, destabilized proteins are targeted by the cellular protein quality control (PQC) network, which either corrects the folding defect or targets the protein for degradation. However, the details of how the protein folding and degradation systems collaborate to combat potentially toxic non-native proteins are unknown. To address this issue, we performed systematic studies on destabilized variants of the cytosolic aspartoacylase, ASPA, where loss-of-function variants are linked to Canavan’s disease, an autosomal recessive and lethal neurological disorder, characterized by the spongy degeneration of the white matter in the brain. Using Variant Abundance by Massively Parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), we determined the abundance of 6152 out of the 6260 (~98%) possible single-site missense and nonsense ASPA variants in cultured human cells. The majority of the low abundance ASPA variants are degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and become toxic upon prolonged expression. Variant cellular abundance data correlates with predicted thermodynamic stability, evolutionary conservation, and separates most known disease-linked variants from benign variants. Systematic mapping of degradation signals (degrons) shows that inherent primary degrons in ASPA are located in buried regions, and reveals that the wild-type ASPA C-terminal region functions as a degron. Collectively, our data can be used to interpret Canavan’s disease variants and also offer mechanistic insight into how ASPA missense variants are targeted by the PQC system. These are essential steps towards future implementation of precision medicine for Canavan’s disease.","We profiled basal gene expressed levels of 21 cell lines (18 cancer and 3 non-tumorigenic) using Affymetrix HG-U133_plus2 GeneChip microarrays.

However, the latter has still been poorly explored. Here, we compared and analyzed the time course of the various cell types constituting the MuSC niche during muscle generation in young and old mice. Aging altered the amplification of all niche cells with particularly prominent phenotypes in macrophages that impaired the resolution of inflammation in the old regenerating muscle. RNAsequencing of FACs-isolated MuSCs and non-myogenic niche cells during  regeneration uncovered specific profiles and kinetics of genes and molecular pathways differentially regulated in old versus young regenerating muscle, indicating that each cell type responded to aging in a specific manner. These data provide a unique resource to study the aging of the MuSC niche.","Osteoclasts are sole bone-resorbing cells and are formed by the fusion of osteoclast precursor cells (OCPs) derived from myeloid lineage cells. Animal studies reveal that circulating osteoclast precursor cells (cOCPs) in blood travel to bone and fuse with bone-resident osteoclasts. However, the characteristics of human cOCPs and their association with bone diseases remain elusive. We have identified and characterized human cOCPs and found a positive association between cOCPs and osteoporosis. Sorted cOCPs have a higher osteoclastogenic potential than other myeloid cells and effectively differentiate into osteoclasts. cOCPs exhibit distinct morphology and transcriptomic signatures. The frequency of cOCPs in the blood varies among treatment-naïve postmenopausal women and has an inverse correlation with lumbar spine bone density and a positive correlation with serum CTX, a bone resorption marker. The increased cOCPs in treatment-naïve osteoporosis patients were significantly diminished by denosumab, a widely used antiresorptive therapy. Our study reveals the distinctive identity of human cOCPs and the potential link between the dynamic regulation of cOCPs and osteoporosis and its treatment. Taken together, our study enhances our understanding of human cOCPs and highlights a potential opportunity to measure cOCPs through a simple blood test, which could potentially identify high-risk individuals.","Osteoclasts are sole bone-resorbing cells and are formed by the fusion of osteoclast precursor cells (OCPs) derived from myeloid lineage cells.

It is characterized by weakness, frequent falls, cognitive decline, increased hospitalization and dead, and represents a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The fact that frailty is recognized as a reversible condition, encourages the identification of earlier biomarkers to timely predict and prevent its occurrence. SAMP8 (Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone-8) mice represent the most appropriate preclinical model to this aim and were used in this study to carry transcriptional and metabolic analyses in the brain and plasma respectively, upon a characterization at cognitive, motor, structural and neuropathological level at 2.5, 6 and 9 months of age. At 2.5 months SAMP8 mice started displaying memory deficits, muscle weakness and motor impairment. Functional alterations were associated with a neurodevelopment deficiency associated with reduced neuronal density and glial cell loss. Through transcriptomics we identified specific genetic signatures well distinguishing SAMP8 mice at 6 months and correlating with motor and cognitive dysfunction, whereas plasma metabolomics allowed to segregate SAMP8 mice from SAMR1 already at 2.5 months of age by detecting constitutively lower levels of acylcarnitines and lipids in SAMP8 at all ages investigated. Our findings suggest that specific genetic alterations at central level, as well as metabolomic changes in plasma, might allow to early assess a frail condition leading to dementia development, which paves the foundation for future investigation in a clinical setting.","Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is an early decline in ovarian function that leads to infertility. Conventional treatments for chemotherapy-induced POI are unsatisfactory. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a therapeutic option, but the impact of estrogen niche-respond MSC secretome on ovarian regeneration and circadian rhythm remains unknown. This study revealed that the secretome of ER+pcMSCs (conditioned medium [CM] and E2-CM, respectively) significantly reduced the CTX-induced defects in ovarian folliculogenesis and circadian rhythm. The CM/E2-CM also reduced granulosa cell apoptosis and rescued angiogenesis in POI ovarian tissues. E2-CM presented a better effect than the CM. Cytokine array analysis showed a significant increase in cytokine/growth factors associated with immunomodulation and angiogenesis (including angiogenin). Neutralizing angiogenin in the CM/E2-CM significantly decreased its ability to promote HUVEC tube formation in vitro. Importantly, the ER+pcMSC secretome restored the CTX-induced circadian rhythm defects, including the expression of both the genes and proteins associated with ovarian circadian clock (such as Rora, E4bp4, Rev-erbα, and Dbp) and the locomotor activity. Further exosomal miRNA analysis showed the involved miRNAs in targeting the genes associated with POI rescue (Pten and Pdcd4), Caspase-3, estrogen synthesis (Cyp19a1), and importantly the ovarian clock regulation (E4bp4, Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ).","Brain calcification, the ectopic mineral deposits of calcium phosphate, is a common radiological finding in elderly and in various neurodegenerative disorders and a diagnostic criterion for primary familial brain calcification (PFBC). We made use of single nuclei RNA sequencing to understand the effect of calcification pathology in the  Pdgfb (ret/ret) model of PFBC. Calcifications are located in deep brain regions - hypothalamus, thalamus, mid brain, pons of Pdgfb (ret/ret) mice and absent in control Pdgfb (ret/wt) mice. Forebrain cortex and hippocampus regions in both genotypes are calcification free. Detailed descriptions of the mouse model can be found in the following publications:","Pediatric high-grade gliomas, including diffuse midline gliomas (DMG), harbor mutually exclusive tumor location specific histone mutations. Using immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse models, we demonstrate the predominant non-neoplastic cell population are infiltrating myeloid cells, including peripheral monocytes and brain resident microglia. Single cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry demonstrate the presence of unique myeloid cell populations distinctly shaped by the specific histone mutation. Disease associated myeloid cell phenotypes are identified, resembling those found in other neurodegenerative diseases, and demonstrate immune permissive characteristics. H3.3K27M DMGs, the most aggressive DMG subtype, demonstrate enrichment of disease associated myeloid cells as well as proliferating myeloid and tumor cells.","Adult skeletal muscle stem cells, also known satellite cells (SCs), are quiescent and activate in response to injury. However, the activation mechanisms of quiescent SCs (QSCs) remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the metabolic regulation of SC activation by identifying regulatory metabolites that promote SC activation. Using targeted metabolomics, we found that spermidine acts as a regulatory metabolite to promote SC activation and muscle regeneration in mice. Mechanistically, spermidine activates SCs via generating hypusinated eIF5A. Using SC-specific eIF5A-knockout (KO) and Myod-KO mice, we further found that eIF5A is required for spermidine-mediated SC activation by controlling MyoD translation. More significantly, depletion of eIF5A in SCs results in impaired muscle regeneration in mice. Together, the findings of our study define a novel mechanism that is essential for SC activation and acts via spermidine-eIF5A-mediated MyoD translation. Our findings suggest that the spermidine-eIF5A axis represents a promising pharmacological target in efforts to activate endogenous SCs for the treatment of muscular disease.","In this study, we explored the roles of histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the developmental dynamics of the mouse brain. We discovered that these epigenetic regulators, HDAC1/2, are crucial in mediating the transition from neural epithelial cells (NEs) to radial glial cells (RGCs). To probe the epigenomic influence of HDAC1/2 on cortical development, we utilized a suite of techniques including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and H3K27ac Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) in both wild-type (WT) and HDAC1/2-deficient brain samples. Our analysis identified a significant dysregulation of numerous transcription-related genes in the HDAC1 and HDAC2 mutant brains. These findings underscore the critical role of HDAC1/2 as epigenetic modulators in the NE-to-RGC transition.","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant mRNA modification in the brain which plays important roles in neurodevelopment and brain function. However, due to technical limitations, global profiling of m6A sites within the individual cell types that make up the brain has not been possible. Here, we develop a mouse model that enables transcriptome-wide m6A detection in any tissue of interest and at single-cell resolution. We use these mice to map m6A across different brain regions and within single cells of the mouse cortex and discover a high degree of shared methylation across brain regions and cell types. However, we also identify a small number of differentially methylated mRNAs in neurons that encode important regulators of neuronal signaling, and we discover that microglia have lower levels of m6A compared to other cell types. Finally, we perform single-cell m6A mapping in aged mice and identify many transcripts with age-dependent changes in m6A.","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant mRNA modification in the brain which plays important roles in neurodevelopment and brain function.

How macrophages spatially adapt and diversify their functions to support the architectural requirements of actively regenerating tissue remains unknown. In this study, we reconstructed the dynamic trajectories of myeloid cells isolated from acutely injured and early-stage dystrophic muscles. We identified divergent subsets of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and validated markers (e.g., GPNMB) and transcriptional regulators associated with defined functional states. In dystrophic muscle, specialized repair-associated subsets exhibited distinct macrophage diversity and reduced DC heterogeneity. Integrating spatial transcriptomics analyses with immunofluorescence uncovered the ordered distribution of subpopulations and multilayered regenerative inflammation zones (RIZs) where distinct macrophage subsets are organized in functional zones around damaged myofibers supporting all phases of regeneration. Importantly, intermittent glucocorticoid treatment disrupted the RIZs. Our findings suggest that macrophage subtypes mediated the development of the highly ordered architecture of regenerative tissues, unveiling the principles of the structured yet dynamic nature of regenerative inflammation supporting effective tissue repair.

Prostate specific-Pten-deficient mouse models develop prostate cancer eventually progressing to CRPC, also due to alterations of the tumor immune infiltrate.","Sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27a1) is a primary enzyme that is involved in the Alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis, which is particularly enhanced during pregnancy. However, the role of this enzyme during fetal organ formation was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that 27-hydroxylase activity in the mother is essential for the progression of pregnancy and organ formation in the fetuses. Maternal depletion of Cyp27a1 reduced success pregnancy rate and litter size. In addition, all of the delivered newborn mice died due to respiratory distress syndrome resulting from the absence of mature alveolar epithelial cells. These phenotypes were caused by 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-HC) accumulating in Cyp27a1 deficient mice. Mechanistically, 7α-HC bound to and destabilized a protein Fau, mediating the assembly of ribosomes, the down-regulation of which led to lower protein synthesis and polysome formation. Our study discovered the essential metabolic pathway protecting the developing fetuses from a toxic metabolite.","The establishment of an early pro-regenerative niche is crucial for tissue regeneration. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptosis accounts for the release of inflammatory cytokines upon various insults. However, little is known about its role in tissue regeneration followed by homeostatic maintenance. Here, we show that macrophage GSDMD deficiency delayed tissue recovery, with little impact on the local inflammatory milieu or the lytic pyroptosis process. Metabolite secretome profiling of hyperactivated macrophages unveiled the non-canonical metabolite-secreting function of GSDMD. And we further identified 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) as a bioactive pro-healing oxylipin, secreted from hyperactive macrophages in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Indeed, accumulation of 11,12-EET by direct supplementation or deletion of its hydrolytic enzyme Ephx2 accelerated muscle regeneration. We further demonstrated that the Ephx2 level accumulated within aged muscle, which led to a decreased intramuscular 11,12-EET level. And consecutive 11,12-EET treatment rejuvenated aged muscle. Mechanistically, 11,12-EET amplifies fibroblast growth factor/FGF receptor (FGF-FGFR) signaling by modulating FGF liquid-liquid phase separation, hence boosting the activation and proliferation of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). These data depict a GSDMD-guided metabolite crosstalk between macrophages and MuSCs that governs the repair process, which offers new therapeutic insights for the regeneration of injured or aged tissues.","Cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced acute muscle injury is a paradigmatic self-limiting sterile injury model for exploring the tissue regeneration process, which consists of a series of tightly-regulated events, including an initial inflammatory response the activation of muscle stem cells (MuSCs, also termed satellite cells) during the early stage after injury, as well as later inflammation resolution along with MuSC proliferation and differentiation. This study set out to determine the potential impact of lipid 11,12-EET on murine MuSCs function.","Vertebrae formation is the defining feature of all vertebrates1,2. Yet, each vertebrate species appears to have a unique timing mechanism for forming somites along the vertebral column3-5. Human vertebrate formation remains poorly studied due to technical and ethical limitations. Here we report the generation of self-renewing stem cells with characteristic presomitic mesoderm (PSM) features by reprogramming epithelial cells isolated from human urine. These induced expandable presomitic mesoderm progenitor cells (UiPSM) proliferated extensively for more than 30 passages in chemically defined conditions, robustly producing 1040 UiPSM cells. UiPSM established presomitic mesodermal transcription profile, not detected pluripotency, ectoderm and endoderm related genes. UiPSM developed into presomitic mesodermal lineage cells, such as skeletal muscle cells(skm), osteoblast and chrondroblast cells in vivo and vitro, when transplanted UiPSM derived human skm cells in muscle injury model, the skm cells can survive in vivo and contribute to muscle regeneration up to one month. Thus, UiPSM is a powerful system to study human somite development and provide strategies for regenerative medicine in musculoskeletal system","ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) inhibitors have the potential of modulating central processes in protein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, which can have relevant physiological consequences in aging and age-related diseases. Here, we show that hepatic phospho-active ACLY correlates with overweight and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score in humans. Wild-type mice treated chronically with the ACLY inhibitor potassium hydroxycitrate exhibited delayed early mortality. In AML12 hepatocyte cultures, the ACLY inhibitors potassium hydroxycitrate, SB-204990, and bempedoic acid fostered lipid accumulation, which was also observed in the liver of healthy-fed mice treated with potassium hydroxycitrate. Analysis of soleus tissue indicated that potassium hydroxycitrate produced the modulation of wound healing processes. In vivo, potassium hydroxycitrate modulated locomotor function toward increased wire hang performance and reduced rotarod performance in healthy-fed mice, and improved locomotion in mice exposed to cardiotoxin-induced muscle atrophy. Our findings implicate ACLY and ACLY inhibitors in different aspects of aging and muscle regeneration.","CblX is a recently described X-linked variant of combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblC type, which is the most common inborn error of intracellular cobalamin metabolism. While cblC is due to mutations in MMACHC, which is in the cobalamin metabolic pathway, cblX is caused by mutations in the transcriptional cofactor HCFC1 and its obligate transcription factor partner RONIN . Since HCFC1 and RONIN jointly regulate MMACHC transcription, cblX patients suffer from low levels of MMACHC during development and thus develop a disease highly similar to cblC. Beyond this finding, there is little else known about the other genes de-regulated in cblX and the resulting pathophysiology. Therefore, we have generated the first mouse models of this disease (Hcfc1A115V/Y and RoninF80L/F80L). We show that our cblX models exhibit the expected metabolic perturbations, along with CNS, hematopoietic and cardiac developmental defects, typically observed in cblC patients. We also uncovered a large cohort of target genes that encode ribosome protein subunits as well as unexpected phenotypes that we ascribe to deregulation of ribosome biogenesis impacting normal translation during development. In addition to identifying RONIN and HCFC1 as new transcriptional regulators of ribosome biogenesis, we establish cblX as a complex syndrome exhibiting aspects of cblC and a ribosomopathy.","The overall goal of the project is to generate a potential mouse model for Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare autosomal recessive bile synthesis disorder. Patients with this disorder were found to have mutations in Cyp27a1 gene, which results in deficiency of the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. This loss leads to inhibition of cholesterol being converted into bile acids. Global deletion of Cyp27a1 in mice showed none of the CTX phenotype and do not accumulate bile alcohols. As livers of these mice show tremendous upregulation of Cyp3a4, so we hypothesized that it may have \"detoxified’ the intermediates and therefore presented a normal phenotype. For answering this, we made double KO mice with Cyp27a1-/- and Cyp3a cluster (Cyp3a13/57/16/41/44/11/25/59) and found no phenotype till 6 months of age.","Evidence suggests that increases in ploidy have occurred frequently in the evolutionary history of organisms, and can serve adaptive functions to specialized, somatic cells in multicellular organisms (Edgar &amp; Orr-Weaver, 2001; Orr-Weaver, 2015; Van De Peer et al., 2017). However, the sudden multiplication of all chromosome content may present physiological challenges to the cells in which it occurs. Experimental studies have associated increases in ploidy with reduced cell survival and proliferation (Andalis et al., 2004; Fujiwara et al., 2005). To understand the physiological challenges that suddenly-increased chromosome content imposes on cells, we used S. cerevisiae cells to ask how much chromosomal DNA cells may contain, and what determines this limit. We generated polyploid cells using two distinct methods causing cells to undergo endoreplication and identified the maximum ploidy of these cells, 32-64C. We found that physical determinants that alleviate or exacerbate cell surface stress increase and decrease the limit to ploidy, respectively. We also used these cells to investigate gene expression changes associated with increased ploidy, and identified the repression of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. We propose that ploidy is inherently limited by the impacts of growth in size, which accompany whole genome duplication, to cell surface integrity.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Studying the functional consequences of structural variants (SVs) in mammalian genomes is challenging because: 1) SVs arise much less commonly than single nucleotide variants or small indels; and 2) methods to generate, map and characterize SVs in model systems are underdeveloped. To address these challenges, we developed Genome-Shuffle-seq, a method that enables the multiplex generation and mapping of thousands of SVs (deletions, inversions, translocations, extrachromosomal circles) throughout mammalian genomes. We also demonstrate the co-capture of SV identity with single-cell transcriptomes, facilitating the measurement of SVs’ impact on gene expression. We anticipate Genome-Shuffle-seq will be broadly useful for the systematic exploration of the functional consequences of SVs on gene expression, chromatin landscape, and 3D nuclear architecture, while also initiating a path towards a minimal mammalian genome.","Intercellular mitochondrial transfer has recently been discovered as a strategy for local microenvironment regulation and repair. However, improving the efficiency of mitochondrial transfer and reducing immune rejection caused by implants is challenging for its application in bone regeneration tissue engineering. We found that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC)s can obtain mitochondria from macrophages through tunnel nanotubes (TNT)s. Mitochondria are crucial for the metabolism and function of BMSC. We further designed a composite hydrogel based on aldehyde sodium hyaluronate and chitosan as the network matrix, containing anti-inflammatory dimethyl itaconate (DMI) and macrophage-targeted zwitterionic nanoparticles (MDVNPs). The acidic bone injury microenvironment triggers a reversible Schiff base reaction in response to pH; further, the released DMI upregulates the M2 phenotype of macrophages by reducing the ROS level. Subsequently, MDVNPs with targeting, high transfection, and low immunogenicity accelerated the efficiency of mitochondrial transfer between macrophages and BMSC by increasing the expression of the mitochondrial transfer regulatory protein Rho GTPase 1 (Miro1). In vitro studies have confirmed that promoting mitochondrial transfer can effectively increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) levels in BMSC, promoting osteoblastic differentiation. In the mouse model of critical defect, the composite hydrogel (Gel@MDI) can reduce inflammatory reactions, improve energy metabolism, and enhance bone repair by promoting the balance between the immune system and bone metabolism. This study establishes a potential method for the immune microenvironment to enhance cellular mitochondrial bioenergy and achieve tissue regeneration by regulating mitochondrial transfer between cells.","The MDA-MB-468 triplicate-negative breast cancer cells were treated with 18 nmol/L gamabufotalin (CS-6) or DMSO for 24 h. Then, RNA-seq was performed to explore the differentially expressed genes.","Background: Liver cancer is the third deadliest type of cancer, posing a serious threat to human health. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. C. sinensis, classified as a definite group I carcinogen by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), is an important risk factor for HCC. Although many studies have shown that C. sinensis infection affects the prognosis of HCC patients, the specific mechanisms are still unclear, especially the dynamics and regulatory roles of chromatin accessibility. Results: In this study, we integrated ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq data to elucidate changes in the epigenetics of HCC after the C. sinensis infection. Many different accessibility regions (DARs) were identified both in tumors and adjacent tissue after the C. sinensis infection. Meanwhile, top TFs whose motifs were enriched in DAR were found, such as HNF4a, FOXI1, etc. Although there were slight deviations, epigenetic changes were found to be consistent with gene expression levels. We also revealed that H3K9ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 were associated with chromatin accessibility. Importantly, we also found potential evidence that C. sinensis infection would alter the spatial structure of the HCC genome. Finally, both molecular experimental results and clinical data certified that C. sinensis infection would promote the metastasis of HCC. Conclusions: C. sinensis infection will remodel the chromatin accessibility of HCC, leading to changes in gene expression levels. This study provides conclusive evidence that C. sinensis infection alters the epigenetics of HCC.","RNA seq was applied to the lung and liver tissues from mice with different treatment regimen to evaluate the potential effects on global transcription.","The current level of knowledge on transcriptome responses triggered by Caesalpinia sappan (CS) extract in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection is limited. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to detect significant genes and pathways involved in CS extract supplementation responsiveness of PBMCs after PRRSV infection. RNA sequencing was conducted on PBMCs, which were isolated from six weaned piglets. The resultant transcriptional responses were examined by mRNA sequencing. Differential expression analysis identified 263 and 274 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the PRRSV and CTRL groups, and the PRRSV+CS and CTRL groups, respectively. Among these, ZNF646 and KAT5 emerged as the most promising candidate genes, potentially influencing the interaction between PRRSV-infected PBMCs and CS extract supplementation through the regulation of gene networks and cellular homeostasis during stress. Two pathways were detected to be associated with CS extract supplementation responsiveness: the cellular response to stress pathway and the NF-kB signaling pathway. Consequently, our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying cellular stress response and the NF-κB signaling pathway in PRRSV-infected PBMCs, and identifies a potential application of CS extract for activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, by supplementing CS extract in PBMC cells infected with PRRSV, we found that CS extract modulates PRRSV infection by inducing cellular stress, which is regulated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. This induced stress creates an adverse environment for PRRSV survival. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the therapeutic targets and pathogenesis of PRRSV infection. Importantly, our results demonstrate that CS extract has the potential to be a candidate for modulating PRRSV infection.","Anonynous donor kidneys were sequenced using the Nanopore long-read direct cDNA sequencing kit (SQK-DCS109) and R9.4.1 flow cells.","To compare gene expression between the materal X (Xm) and paternal X (Xp), we used a flurorescence-based cell sorting to separate the maternal X from the paternal X. Then we performed gene expression analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of young Xm and Xp cells  To compare gene expression between the materal X (Xm) and paternal X (Xp) in neurons from both young and old mice, we used a flurorescence-based cell sorting to separate the maternal X from the paternal X. Then we performed gene expression analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of young and old Xm and Xp neurons.","Deletion of the global transcription factor PacR in Anabaena triggers heterocyst formation even in NO3- containing medium, likely due to impaired NO3- uptake and disrupted NH4+ assimilation in the GOGAT cycle. This phenotype may be exacerbated by reduced PSI-yield and reduced expression of ferredoxin, which may lead to less reducing equivalents for nitrogen uptake and fixation. These results highlight PacR’s role as a global regulator of carbon metabolism and photosynthesis while also establishing its involvement in regulating nitrogen metabolism.","Through variation in the cancer cell and their immune infiltrates each tumor represents a unique problem, but therapeutic targets can be found in the shared features. Radiation therapy can change the interaction between the cancer cells and the stroma through release of innate adjuvants including the STING agonist cGAMP. Enpp1 is a phosphodiesterase that can be expressed by cancer cells and can degrade cGAMP. Enpp1 can therefore limit innate adjuvant availability following radiation therapy. We observed that many cancer cells lack Enpp1 expression, but that Enpp1 expression is retained in cells of the tumor stroma and this expression in the tumor stroma limits tumor control by radiation therapy. We demonstrate the efficacy of a novel Enpp1 inhibitor and show that this inhibitor improves tumor control by radiation even where the cancer cells lack Enpp1. We show that the mechanism requires STING and type I IFN receptor expression by non-cancer cells, and is dependent on CD8 T cells as a final effector mechanism of tumor control. This suggests that Enpp1 inhibition may be an effective partner for radiation therapy regardless of whether cancer cells express Enpp1, and identifies a novel therapeutic Enpp1 inhibitor suitable for combination therapies in immuno-oncology.","Hepatocytes-like cells (HLC) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells show great promise for cell-based liver therapies and disease modelling. However, their application is currently hindered by the low production yields of existing protocols. We aim to develop a bioprocess able to generate high numbers of HLC. We used stirred-tank bioreactors with a rational control of dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) for the optimization of HLC production as 3D aggregates. We evaluated the impact of controlling DO at physiological levels (4%O2) during hepatic progenitors’ stage on cell proliferation and differentiation efficiency. Whole transcriptome analysis and biochemical assays were performed to provide a detailed characterization of HLC quality attributes. When DO was controlled at 4%O2 during the hepatic progenitors’ stage, cells presented an upregulation of genes associated with hypoxia-inducible factor pathway and a downregulation of oxidative stress genes. This condition promoted higher HLC production (maximum cell concentration: 2×106 cell/mL) and improved differentiation efficiencies (80% Albumin-positive cells) when compared to the bioreactor operated under atmospheric oxygen levels (21%O2, 0.6×106 cell/mL, 43% Albumin positive cells). These HLC exhibited functional characteristics of hepatocytes: capacity to metabolize drugs, ability to synthesize hepatic metabolites, and inducible cytochrome P450 activity. Bioprocess robustness was confirmed with HLC derived from different donors, including a primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) patient. The generated PH1.HLC showed metabolic features of PH1 disease with higher secretion of oxalate compared with HLC generated from healthy individuals. This work reports a reproducible bioprocess, that shows the importance of controlling DO at physiological levels to increase HLC production, and the HLC capability to display PH1 disease features.","Gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level is prevalent in all domains of life. In bacteria, ProQ-like proteins have emerged as important RNA chaperones facilitating RNA stability and RNA duplex formation. In the major human pathogen V. cholerae, post-transcriptional gene regulation is key for virulence, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance, yet the role of ProQ has not been studied. Here, we show that ProQ interacts with hundreds of transcripts in V. cholerae, including the highly abundant FlaX small RNA (sRNA). Global analyses of RNA duplex formation using RIL-Seq (RNA interaction by ligation and sequencing) revealed a vast network of ProQ-assisted interactions and identified a role for FlaX in motility regulation. Specifically, FlaX base-pairs with multiple sites on the flaB flagellin mRNA, preventing 30S ribosome binding and translation initiation. V. cholerae cells lacking flaX display impaired motility gene expression, altered flagella composition, and reduced swimming in liquid environments. Our results provide a global view on ProQ-mediated RNA duplex formation and pinpoint the mechanistic and phenotypic consequences associated with ProQ-associated sRNAs in V. cholerae.","Purpose: Gut microbiota-derived metabolites play a pivotal role in the maintenance of local gut homeostasis and can even induce systemic effects via accumulation in the bloodstream. Here, we demonstrate that mono-colonization of germ-free (GF) mice with Clostridium sporogenes protects mice from inflamation and death induced by DSS colitis. Method: 8-12-week-old male mice (GF, SPF and GF colonized with C. sporogenes (CS)) were treated with 2.5% DSS in drinking water for 5 days and colon tissue was isolated on day 7. RNA was isolated from the colon tissue and RNA sequenzing was performed. Results:  Mono-colonization of GF mice with Clostridium sporogenes protected the mice from DSS colitis induced death, while producing high amounts of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), branched chain (BCFA) and short-chain (SCFA) fatty acids. In comparison to CS mice, SPF mice showed much higher levels of inflammatory related genes and a worse histological score. Conclusion: Histological stainings and the RNAseq both showed high levels of protection of C. sporogenes colonized mice in colitis, compared to SPF and GF animals. The data provide evidence for a therapeutic  potential of C. sporogenes for IBD patients.","For the bilateral intrastriatal delivery of AAV expressing control or TRAX shRNA, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine HCl (87.56 and 7.5 ug/kg, respectively, via an intraperitoneal injection) and injected with the indicated AAV (2 µl per injection spot, 2.5*10^9 vector genome/µl) with a 10 ml syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) at a rate of 0.5 ul/min. The AAV was injected at the desired position: AP+0.5, L±2, DV-2.5 and -3.5 mm relative to bregma and the dura surface. Then the mouse brains were removed from the mice directly for dissection of striatum. RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent or miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). DNase digestion was performed by the DNA-free™ Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and purity of RNA were measured at 260, 280 and 230 nm by a NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA was qualified by a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with an RNA 6000 LabChip kit (Agilent Technology). For mRNA, the RNA was prepared based on Illumina’s official protocol. Library construction was carried out by TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) followed by AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) size selection. Libraries were sequenced using sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) technology (Illumina). Sequencing data and FASTQ reads were generated using an inhouse Welgene ’Biotech pipeline according to Illumina’s base calling program bcl2fastq v2.20.","Substance use disorders (SUDs) induce widespread molecular dysregulation in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region pivotal for coordinating motivation and reward, which is linked to neural and behavioral disturbances promoting addiction. Despite the overlapping symptomatology of SUDs, different drug classes exert partly unique influences on neural circuits, cell types, physiology, and gene expression. To better understand common and divergent molecular mechanisms governing SUD pathology, we characterized the cell-type-specific restructuring of the NAc transcriptional landscape after psychostimulant or opioid exposure. We combined fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting and RNA sequencing to profile NAc D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) across cocaine exposure paradigms, including initial exposure, prolonged withdrawal after repeated exposure, and re-exposure post-withdrawal. Our analyses reveal that D1 MSNs display many convergent transcriptional responses across the two drugs, whereas D2 MSNs manifest highly divergent responses, with morphine causing far more adaptations in this cell type.","A hallmark of addiction is the ability of drugs of abuse to trigger relapse after periods of prolonged abstinence. Here, we describe a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby chronic cocaine exposure causes lasting chromatin and downstream transcriptional modifications in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical brain region controlling motivation. We link prolonged withdrawal from cocaine to the depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z, coupled with increased genome accessibility and latent priming of gene transcription, in D1 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1 MSNs) that relate to aberrant gene expression upon drug relapse. The histone chaperone ANP32E removes H2A.Z from chromatin, and we demonstrate that D1 MSN-selective Anp32e knockdown prevents cocaine-induced H2A.Z depletion and blocks cocaine’s rewarding actions. By contrast, very different effects of cocaine exposure, withdrawal, and relapse were found for D2 MSNs. These findings establish histone variant exchange as an important mechanism and clinical target engaged by drugs of abuse to corrupt brain function and behavior.","A hallmark of addiction is the ability of drugs of abuse to trigger relapse after periods of prolonged abstinence.

We have previously identified that aberrant chromatin accessibility, at lymphocyte-specific glucocorticoid-response elements (GREs), is associated with drug resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). To gain a deeper understanding of regulatory mechanisms leading to these epigenetic alterations, we conducted a multi-omics study, to examine changes in chromatin conformation, following the in-vivo treatment of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with glucocorticoid i.e., dexamethasone (DEX). We found that glucocorticoid treatment led to distinct patterns of topological associated domains (TADs) in DEX sensitive and resistant ALLs. Pre-treatment, these TADs were primed by a development-related pioneer transcription factor PU.1, which also occupied GREs in glucocorticoid sensitive but not resistant ALLs. PU.1 binding was associated with lymphocyte-specific activation of GREs and GRE-interacting super-enhancers within the TADs. Furthermore, the PU.1-associated TADs modulated epigenetics and promoted expression of multiple genes, including BIM, ZBTB16, RASA1 and other genes mediating glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in ALL. The inhibition of PU.1 enhanced sensitivity of ALL cells to glucocorticoid treatment. Overall, this study illustrated a link between the lineage-specific efficiency of glucocorticoids and the developmental epigenetic modulators and provides insights into the role of fundamental epigenetics in clinical practice.","NOT PROVIDED; REQUESTED","Assessment of host gene expression is an emerging tool for the diagnosis of human infections. We compared nasal and blood samples for evaluation of the host transcriptomic response in children with acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), symptomatic and asymptomatic picornavirus (PV) infection, and virus-negative asymptomatic controls (Ctrls). RNA was extracted from nasal and blood samples and analyzed by microarray. Despite generally lower quality of nasal RNA, the number of genes detected in each sample type was equivalent.  Nasal gene expression signal derived mainly from epithelial cells but also included a leukocyte contribution that was higher in samples from symptomatic children. The number of genes with increased expression in virus-infected children was comparable in nasal and blood samples, while nasal samples also had large numbers of genes with decreased expression, including many genes associated with ciliary function and assembly. Compared to symptomatic children, those with asymptomatic PV had fewer genes with increased or decreased expression in both sample types. Genes with increased expression in comparisons of symptomatic children versus Ctrls included genes associated with components of innate immunity and apoptosis. Children with RSV but not PV also had increased expression of genes related to the cell cycle. Using nested leave-one-pair-out cross-validation and supervised principal components analysis, we defined sets of genes whose expression patterns accurately classified subjects, with high area-under-the-curve values in receiver operating characteristic analysis. Our results support use of nasal samples to augment pathogen-based tests to diagnose viral respiratory infection.","Prosaposin encodes, in tandem, four small acidic activator proteins (saposins) with specificities for glycosphingolipids hydrolases in lysosomes. To explore the molecular mechanism(s) of disease progression, temporal transcriptome microarray analyses of cerebrum and cerebellum tissues were conducted using mRNA from three prosaposin deficiency mouse models: PS-NA (hypomorphic prosaposin deficiency), PS-/- (prosaposin null) and 4L/PS-NA (a V394L/V394L glucocerebrosidase mutation and PS-NA) mice. Our results indicate that regionally specific gene expression abnormalities preceded the histological and behavioral changes and CEBPD is a candidate regulator of brain disease in prosaposin deficiency. The alterations of gene expression are detected at birth and are more profound in cerebellum than cerebrum.

Intracellular concentrations of cdG are controlled by the interplay of diguanylate cyclase (DGC) enzymes, which synthesize cdG to promote biofilms, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, which hydrolyse cdG to drive motility. To track the complete regulatory logic of how V. cholerae responds to changing cdG levels, we followed a time course of overexpression of either the V. harveyi diguanylate cyclase QrgB or a variant of QrgB lacking catalytic activity (QrgB*). We find that QrgB increases cdG levels relative to QrgB* for 30 minutes after overexpression, but the effect of QrgB on cdG levels plateaus at 30 minutes, indicating tight adaptive control of cdG levels. In contrast, loss of VpsR, a master regulator activating biofilm formation upon binding to cdG, leads to higher baseline levels of cdG and continuously increasing cdG through 60 minutes after QrgB induction, revealing the existence of a negative feedback loop on cdG levels operating through VpsR. Through a combination of RNA polymerase ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and genetic approaches, we show that the PDE CdgC is activated by VpsR at high cdG concentrations, mediating this negative feedback on cdG levels. We further identify a transcript encoded within, and antisense to, the cdgC open reading frame which we name sRNA negative regulator of CdgC (SnrC). RNA polymerase ChIP-seq and RNA-seq demonstrate SnrC to be expressed specifically under conditions of high cdG in the absence of VpsR. Ectopic SnrC expression increases cdG levels in a manner depending on CdgC, demonstrating that its effect on cdG levels is likely through interference with CdgC production. Further, although cells lacking cdgC exhibit enhanced biofilm formation, these mutants are outcompeted by wild type V. cholerae in colonization assays that reward a combination of attachment, dispersal, and motility. These results underscore the importance of negative feedback regulation of cdG to maintain appropriate homeostatic levels for efficient transitioning between biofilm formation and motility, both of which are necessary over the course of the V. cholerae infection cycle.","The signaling molecule cyclic di-GMP (cdG) controls the switch between bacterial motility and biofilm production, and fluctuations in cellular levels of cdG have been implicated in Vibrio cholerae pathogenesis.

While the disorder presents with primarily neurological symptoms, there is limited knowledge about the specific brain-related changes that result from PMM2 deficiency. We found aberrant neural activity in 2D neuronal networks from individuals with PMM2-CDG. Utilizing multi-omics datasets from 3D brain organoids derived from individuals with PMM2-CDG, we found widespread decreases in protein glycosylation, highlighting impaired glycosylation as a key pathological feature of PMM2-CDG. Furthermore, we identified impaired mitochondrial structure and abnormal glucose metabolism in PMM2-CDG brain organoids, indicating disturbances in energy metabolism. Correlation between PMM2 enzymatic activity in brain organoids and symptom severity suggests that the level of PMM2 enzyme function directly influences neurological manifestations. These findings enhance our understanding of specific brain-related perturbations associated with PMM2-CDG, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential directions for therapeutic interventions.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Biofilms are heterogeneous bacterial communities featured by high persister prevalence, responsible for antibiotic tolerance. However, the mechanisms underlying persister formation within biofilms remained ambiguous. Here, by developing and utilizing a ribosomal RNA depleted bacterial single-cell RNA-seq method, RiboD-mSPLiT, we resolved biofilm heterogeneity and discovered pdeI as a marker gene for persister subgroup within biofilms. Remarkably, our findings elucidated that PdeI upregulates cellular levels of c-di-GMP, which acts as an antitoxin to modulate the toxicity of toxin protein HipH. HipH localizes on nucleoid and functions as a potent DNase, inducing cells into a viable but non-culturable state. Conversely, c-di-GMP interacts with HipH, reducing its genotoxic effects and enabling cells to enter a persister state, resulting in drug tolerance. Importantly, by targeting this toxin-antitoxin system, we repressed drug tolerance in Uropathogenic Escherichia coli infections, offering promising therapeutic strategies against chronic and relapsing infections.","Current base editors use DNA deaminases, including cytidine deaminase in cytidine base editor (CBE) or adenine deaminase in adenine base editor (ABE), to facilitate transition nucleotide substitutions. Combining CBE or ABE with glycosylase enzymes can induce limited transversion mutations. Nonetheless, a critical demand remains for base editors capable of generating alternative mutation types, such as T&gt;G corrections. In this study, we leveraged pre-trained protein language models to optimize a uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) variant with altered specificity for thymines (eTDG). Notably, after two rounds of testing fewer than 50 top-ranking variants, more than 50% exhibited over 1.5-fold enhancement in enzymatic activities. When eTDG was fused with nCas9, it induced programmable T-to-S (G/C) substitutions and corrected db/db diabetic mutation in mice (up to 55%). Our findings not only establish orthogonal strategies for developing novel base editors, but also demonstrate the capacities of protein language models for optimizing enzymes without extensive task-specific training data.","In psychiatric disorders, common and rare genetic variants cause widespread dysfunction of cells and their interactions, especially in the prefrontal cortex, giving rise to psychiatric symptoms. To better understand these processes, we traced the effects of common and rare genetics, and cumulative disease risk scores, to their molecular footprints in human cortical single-cell types. We demonstrated that examining gene expression at single-exon resolution is crucial for understanding the cortical dysregulation associated with diagnosis and genetic risk derived from common variants. We then used disease risk scores to identify a core set of genes that serve as a footprint of common and rare variants in the cortex. Pathways enriched in these genes included dopamine regulation, circadian entrainment, and hormone regulation. Single-nuclei-RNA-sequencing pinpointed these enriched genes to excitatory cortical neurons. This study highlights the importance of studying sub-gene-level genetic architecture to classify psychiatric disorders based on biology rather than symptomatology, to identify novel targets for treatment development.","Glycosylation of proteins is an important post-translational modification that comprises two major stages: synthesis and attachment of glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and glycan remodeling in the ER and Golgi apparatus (GA). Genetic disorders impairing a step of this process give rise to a group of pathologies named congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). The most common CDG type is PMM2-CDG, caused by mutations on PMM2 (phosphomannomutase 2) genes. PMM2-CDG clinical presentation vary among affected individuals. CDG condition is considered a form of chronic ER stress. Inhibition of glycosylation results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, which induces a complex protective reaction known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), which includes translational repression, transcriptional activation of ER chaperones, and ER-associated degradation of unfolded proteins. In search for CDG biomarkers, EBV-transformed CDG B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) were used as cellular models due to two main advantages: first, B-LCL are secretory cells that are forced to continuously synthetize proteins such as immunoglobulins, cytokines or other cell to cell communication molecules, so their ER is chronically stressed; second, as immune system cells, they express common genes and share common regulatory mechanisms with nervous system cells such as neurons (affected cell in most CDG patients). In this work we generated a collection of 7 EBV-transformed PMM2-CDG B-LCL by culture of patients' purified blood B lymphocytes with supernatants of the marmoset EBV-leukocyte cell line B95-8, and compared their transcriptome with that of 7 EBV-transformed healthy B-LCL. Our analysis revealed 348 significantly up-regulated and 106 down-regulated protein-coding genes compared to non-CDG cell lines, which included response to stress, transcription factors, glycosylation, motility and cell junction, development and cell (neuron) differentiation and synapse genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified biological consequences associated to gene expression changes in PMM2-CDG cells related to the unfolded protein response (UPR), RNA metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and mitochondria components. Dysregulated important genes were MAN1A1, MGAT2, CHST4, LARGE, ADAM23, SEMA4D, UNC13C, AUTS2, CA2, SMN1, EXOSC2 expressed not only in the immune system but in other tissues including the nervous system that were compatible with CDG pathophysiology. Our results confirm PMM2-CDG EBV-transformed B-LCL as a suitable cell model that expands both our knowledge and tools to study CDG pathology at the cellular level, useful for functional characteristics and potential therapeutic drugs testing.","STING activation induced IRF 1 dependent transcriptional programs in dendritic cells (DCs) determine T cell fate during mucosal host defense activation.","Purpose:  Identify whole lung gene expression patterns in a house dust mite model of severe asthma Methods: Lung gene expression profiles of 10 week old BALB/c female mice were generated by ribosome-depleted, 100 nt, paired-end, stranded RNA-seq with Illumina HiSeq v4.  Sequence reads were analyzed  with Sailfish-cir to identify linear RNA transcripts and circular RNAs. Differential expression of linear RNAs was assessed with Deseq2 . QRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green methods. Results: 100 million sequence reads per sample were mapped to the mouse genome (build mm10) using Sailfish-cir to identify linear and circular RNA transcripts. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes identified upregulation of gene sets for human Th17 high, Th2 low asthma. An LNA/DNA miR-155 antagonist upregulated interferon signaling pathways suggesting a general antiinflammatory effect of LNA/DNA oligos in the lung. Dexamethasone did not consistently reduce expression of Th2 or Th17 biomarker genes. Conclusions: Cyclic di-GMP plus house dust mite allergens elicited a Th2 low, Th17 high gene expression profile that was not consistently modified by treatment with dexamethasone.","Upon systemic bacterial infection, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) migrate to the periphery in order to supply a sufficient number of immune cells. Although pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) reportedly mediate HSPC activation, how HSPCs detect pathogen invasion in vivo remains elusive. Bacteria use the second messenger bis-(3’-5’)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) for a variety of activities. Here we report that c-di-GMP comprehensively regulates both HSPCs and their niche cells through an innate immune sensor, STING, thereby inducing entry into the cell cycle and mobilization of HSPCs, while decreasing the number and repopulation capacity of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs). Furthermore, we show that type I IFN acts as a downstream target of c-di-GMP to inhibit HSPC expansion in the spleen, while  TGF-β1 is required for c-di-GMP-dependent splenic HSPC expansion. Our results define novel machinery underlying dynamic regulation of HSPCs and their niches during bacterial infection through c-di-GMP/STING signaling.","Listeria monocytogenes strain 10403S has been studied extensively for stress response activity toward multiple stressors (acid, osmotic, cold, high temperature, etc.) as well as multiple stress regulons (SigB, CtsR, HrcA, etc.).  Here we aimed to determine the transcriptional response of Listeria monocytogenes in early log phase towards the strong oxidative stress imposed by ClO2.  The elucidation of such a response allows for further a more completel understanding of the mechanism of inactivation by sanitizers, specifically ClO2.","Disruption of N-linked glycosylation has a broad impact on proper glycosylation of nascent glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, which affect multiple signalling pathways( by changing the stability of membrane proteins or the signalling ability of membrane receptors) and may be responsible of the fibrotic stage associated to CDG type-I. We used microarrays to characterize the global changes in  gene expression in three distinct groups of CDG-I patients and we identified a common perturbation in the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in the stress as well as in the fibrotic responses.

Here we identify MYLIP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase thought to specifically target lipoprotein receptors, as a negative regulator of HIF-1α/2α. MYLIP interacts with HIF-1α/2α and catalyzes K27-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 118/442 (HIF-1α) or lysine 117 (HIF-2α). This modification induces proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α, resulting in inhibition of hypoxia signaling. Furthermore, Mylip-deficient bluntsnout bream, zebrafish and mice are more tolerant to hypoxia. These findings reveal a role for MYLIP in regulating hypoxia signaling and identify a target for developing fish strains with high hypoxia tolerance for the benefit of the","Dyrk1A deficiency is linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delays, intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Haploinsufficiency of Dyrk1a in mice reportedly leads to ASD-related phenotypes. However, the key pathological mechanisms remain unclear and human DYRK1A mutations remain uncharacterized in mice. Here, we generated and studied Dyrk1a-knockin mice carrying a human ASD patient mutation (Ile48LysfsX2; Dyrk1a-I48K mice). These mice display severe microcephaly, social and cognitive deficits, dendritic shrinkage, excitatory synaptic deficits, and altered phospho-proteomic patterns enriched for multiple signaling pathways and synaptic proteins.","The tongue facilitates vital activities such as swallowing. Swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) are common in the elderly and in many adult-onset neuromuscular diseases. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), dysphagia is often the first symptom. OPMD is an autosomal dominant myopathy caused by a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the gene encoding PABPN1. The expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble nuclear aggregates that reduce the levels of the soluble form. Clinical tongue involvement in OPMD has been documented but is poorly understood. Tongue histopathology was investigated in OPMD mouse models using light and electron microscopy. Muscle histopathology was predominantly affected by age. PABPN1 nuclear aggregates were found at moderate levels, whereas deposition of insoluble PABPN1 in blood vessels was already prominent in 4-month-old mice. RNA signatures of the OPMD tongue were enriched for mitochondrial and cytoskeletal genes, suggesting an energy and contractile deficit.  ","To investigate SLC7A11 inhibition-induced ferroptosis in LDHB-deficient lung cancer cells requires glutaminolysis","The integrity of the blood–retina barrier (BRB) is crucial for phototransduction and vision, by tightly restricting transport of molecules between the blood and surrounding neuronal cells. Breakdown of the BRB leads to the development of retinal diseases. Here, we show that Netrin-1/Unc5b and Norrin/Lrp5 signaling establish a zonated endothelial cell gene expression program that controls BRB integrity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of postnatal BRB-competent mouse retina endothelial cells (ECs), we investigate &gt;100 BRB genes encoding Wnt signaling components, tight junction proteins, and ion and nutrient transporters. We find that BRB gene expression is zonated across arteries, capillaries, and veins and regulated by opposing gradients of the Netrin-1 receptor Unc5b and Lrp5-β-catenin signaling between retinal arterioles and venules. Mice deficient for Ntn1 or Unc5b display more BRB leakage at the arterial end of the vasculature, while Lrp5 loss of function causes predominantly venular BRB leakage. ScRNA-seq of Ntn1 and Unc5b mutant ECs reveals down-regulated β-catenin signaling and  BRB gene expression that is rescued by Ctnnb1 overactivation, along with BRB integrity. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 and Norrin additively enhance β-catenin transcriptional activity and Lrp5 phosphorylation via the Discs large homologue 1 (Dlg1) scaffolding protein, and endothelial Lrp5-Unc5b function converges in protection of capillary BRB integrity. These findings explain how arteriovenous zonation is established and maintained in the BRB and reveal that BRB gene expression is regulated at the level of endothelial subtypes.","T cell activation is accompanied by extensive changes in epigenome. However, whether and how high-ordered chromatin organization is involved in CD8+ T cell activation is unclear. Here, we showed extensive changes in the three-dimensional genome during CD8+ T cell activation, associated with changes in gene transcription. Moreover, we identified Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) as an essential mediator in re-organization of spatial chromosomal interactions. Trim28 deficiency impaired CD8+ T cell activation in vitro and in vivo, due to its regulation on autocrine IL-2 production. Mechanistically, TRIM28 bound to genes associated with CD8+ T cell activation and promoted the formation of chromosomal loops. At the loop anchor regions, TRIM28 is likely recruited by CTCF, and required for binding of RNA Pol II and cohesin to form active chromosomal structure. These results thus identify a critical role of TRIM28-dependent chromatin topology in gene transcription during CD8+ T cell activation.","T cell activation is accompanied by extensive changes in epigenome.

The pathophysiology of lung I/R injury involves ferroptosis and elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, while the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on lung I/R injury remains unclear. This research aimed to explore the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on reducing ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells caused by I/R.  First, we identified O-GlcNAc transferase 1 (Ogt1) as a differentially expressed gene in lung epithelial cells of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) patients, using single-cell sequencing, and Gene Ontology analysis (GO analysis) revealed the enrichment of the ferroptosis process. We found a time-dependent dynamic alteration in lung O-GlcNAcylation during I/R injury. Proteomics analysis identified the differentially expressed proteins enriched in ferroptosis and multiple redox-related pathways based on KEGG annotation. Thus, we generated Ogt1-conditional knockout mice and found that Ogt1 deficiency aggravated ferroptosis, as evidenced by lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), Fe2+, as well as alterations in critical protein expression glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Consistently, we found that elevated O-GlcNAcylation inhibited ferroptosis sensitivity in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury-induced TC-1 cells via O-GlcNAcylated NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, both the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that Nrf2 could bind with translation start site (TSS) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and promote its transcriptional activity. As an important rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), elevated G6PDH provided a mass of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to improve the redox state of glutathione (GSH) and eventually led to ferroptosis resistance. Rescue experiments proved that Nrf2 knockdown or Nrf2-T334A (O-GlcNAcylation site) mutation abolished the protective effect of ferroptosis resistance.  In summary, we revealed that O-GlcNAcylation could protect against I/R lung injury by reducing ferroptosis sensitivity via the Nrf2/G6PDH pathway. Our work will provide a new basis for clinical therapeutic strategies for pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute lung injury.","Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally.  Newly metastasising cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours.  There is interest in exploiting this vulnerability to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis.  Here, we show that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, including with aspirin, enhances immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelet TXA2 triggers an immunosuppressive pathway within T cells dependent upon the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor (TCR)-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases.  Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or through platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner dependent upon T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo.  These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway limiting T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing a mechanistic basis for the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.","Airway macrophages (AMs) are critical for resolving inflammation and repairing injured lung tissue, but can also contribute to the development of fibrosis.  AMs were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of Siglec-F KO and WT mice prior to and 7, 14, and 21 days after bleomycin challenge (single dose, 2.5 units/kg, IT).  RNA was isolated using the Qiagen micro plus RNA kit and 200 ng of total RNA was used to generate RNA-Seq libraries.  The libraries were run on the NovaSeq 6000 with 80 million pair-end reads per sample.","Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), characterized by chronic tissue inflammation and fibrosis involving multiple organs, remains a major complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an anti-inflammatory drug approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. We previously reported that DMF effectively inhibits acute GVHD (aGVHD) while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, the role of DMF in cGVHD progression remains unknown. Here, we found that DMF administration significantly suppresses follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation, germinal center formation and alleviates disease severity in different murine cGVHD models. Mechanistically, DMF treatment downregulates IL-21 transcription by activation of Nrf2, thus orchestrating Tfh-related gene program both in mice and humans. The inhibitory role of DMF on Tfh cell differentiation was diminished in Nrf2 deficient T cells. Importantly, the therapeutic potential of DMF in clinical cGVHD has been validated in human data whereby DMF effectively reduces IL-21 production and Tfh cell generation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from active cGVHD patients and further attenuates xenograft GVHD. Collectively, our findings reveal that DMF potently inhibits cGVHD development by repressing Tfh cell differentiation via Nrf2, paving way for the treatment of cGVHD in the clinic.","Following DNA replication, the newly reassembled chromatin is disorganized and must mature to its steady state to maintain both genome and epigenome integrity. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this critical process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac), a mark on newly-synthesized H3, facilitates the remodeling of disorganized nucleosomes in nascent chromatin, and its removal at the subsequent G2/M phase of the cell cycle marks the completion of chromatin maturation. In vitro, H3K56ac enhances the activity of ISWI chromatin remodelers, including yeast ISW1 and its human equivalent SNF2h. In vivo, a deficiency of H3K56ac in nascent chromatin results in the formation of closely packed di-nucleosomes and/or tetra-nucleosomes. In contrast, abnormally high H3K56ac levels disrupt chromatin maturation, leading to genome instability. These findings establish a central role of H3K56ac in chromatin maturation and reveal a mechanism regulating this critical aspect of chromosome replication.","The H3K9me3-specific histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is critical for proper regulation of developmental processes, but the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. Here, we show that deletion of Setdb1 in mouse fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in compromised stem cell function, enhanced myeloerythroid differentiation, and impaired lymphoid development. Notably, Setdb1-deficient HSPCs exhibit reduced quiescence and increased proliferation, accompanied by the acquisition of a lineage-biased transcriptional program. In Setdb1-deficient HSPCs, we identify genomic regions that are characterized by loss of H3K9me3 and increased chromatin accessibility, suggesting enhanced transcription factor (TF) activity. Interestingly, hematopoietic TFs like PU.1 bind these cryptic enhancers in wild-type HSPCs, despite the H3K9me3 status. Thus, our data indicate that SETDB1 restricts activation of nonphysiological TF binding sites which helps to ensure proper maintenance and differentiation of fetal liver HSPCs.","The H3K9me3-specific histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is critical for proper regulation of developmental processes, but the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood.

Single-cell RNAseq analysis of MHCII-mismatched heart transplants developing chronic rejection identified graft IL-33 as a stimulator of tissue repair pathways in infiltrating myeloid cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Using IL-33-deficient donor mice, it was revealed that graft fibroblast-derived IL-33 potently induced Amphiregulin (Areg) expression by recipient Treg. Areg is an epidermal growth factor secreted by multiple immune cells to shape immunomodulation and tissue repair. In particular, Areg is proposed to play a major role in Treg-mediated muscle, epithelium, and nerve repair. Assessing recipient mice with Treg-specific deletion of Areg demonstrated that this pathway surprisingly contributes to chronic rejection. Specifically, heart transplants from recipients with Areg-deficient Tregs exhibited less vasculopathy and vessel-associated fibrotic niches infiltrated by recipient T cells. Mechanistically, we show that Areg does not impact Treg suppressive function, but that IL-33 mediated Treg-secretion of Areg increases fibroblast proliferation and migration. In total, these studies identify how a dysregulated repair response involving interactions between IL-33+ fibroblasts in the allograft and recipient Treg contributes to the progression of chronic rejection.","Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency is a rare genetic disease leading to a severe developmental delay. Some MCT8 deficient patients are not as severely affected than others due to residual thyroid hormone (TH) transport. Previously, we hypothesized that these patients’ mutations destabilize the MCT8 protein, which consequently will be sent for degradation. We have already demonstrated that the chemical chaperone sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) rescues the function of these mutants by stabilizing their protein expression in an overexpressing cell system. Here we expand our previous work and used human iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMECs) as a model. We could show that NaPB rescues decreased mutant MCT8 expression and restores transport function. Furthermore, we identified MCT10 as another TH transporter that contributes to T3 uptake. The decrease in mutant protein expression could be explained by the activation of components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) machinery. Increased expression after NaPB treatment is a consequence of UPR attenuation and the stabilization of MCT8 mRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that NaPB is suitable to stabilize pathogenic missense mutations and activate transport function in a human-derived cell model opening the possibility of repurposing the FDA-approved drug NaPB for MCT8 deficiency.","X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by the antisense insertion of an SVA retrotransposon into the TAF1 gene, encoding for the largest subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIID, which is essential for RNA polymerase II activity. This SVA insertion has been associated with altered TAF1 expression levels, but the cause of this outcome and its link to the development of XDP remain unknown. Unique to the XDP SVA compared to other SVA retrotransposons in the human genome is the amplification of the (GGGAGA)n repeat domain, creating a unique G4-prone region, whose length correlates with age at onset and disease severity. By ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR with the anti-G4 antibody BG4, we assessed that G4s are present in the folded state in the XDP SVA of these cells. Using available G4 ligands, we demonstrated that stabilization of the XDP SVA G4s reduces TAF1 transcripts in the exons around and downstream of the SVA, while increasing the transcription of the upstream exons, possibly through a positive feedback loop.","By ChIP-seq with the anti-G4 antibody BG4, we assessed that G4s are present in the folded state in ctrl and XDP cell tested.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","To elicit a dystonia-like phenotype in a genetically predisposed DYT-TOR1A mouse model (DYT1KI) by performing a right sciatic nerve crush injury.

The disease is commonly associated with additional neurodevelopmental, neurological and neuropsychiatric features. Currently, there are no disease-specific treatments for this condition, resulting in significant morbidity and risk of premature mortality. To investigate the underlying disease mechanisms in childhood-onset DNAJC6 parkinsonism, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from three patients harboring pathogenic loss-of-function DNAJC6 mutations and subsequently developed a midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuronal model of disease. DNAJC6 encodes auxilin, a co-chaperone protein involved in clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling at the presynaptic terminal. When compared to age-matched and CRISPR-corrected isogenic controls, the neuronal cell model revealed disease-specific auxilin deficiency as well as disturbance of synaptic vesicle recycling and homeostasis. We also observed dysregulation of key neurodevelopmental pathways affecting ventral midbrain pattering and neuronal maturation.","SVA retrotransposons remain active in humans and contribute to individual genetic variation. Polymorphic SVA alleles harbor gene-regulatory potential and can cause genetic disease. However, how SVA insertions are controlled and functionally impact human disease is unknown. Here, we dissect the epigenetic regulation and influence of SVAs in cellular models of X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an SVA insertion at the TAF1 locus. We demonstrate that the KRAB zinc finger protein ZNF91 establishes H3K9me3 and DNA methylation over SVAs, including polymorphic alleles, in human neural progenitor cells. The resulting mini-heterochromatin domains attenuate the cis-regulatory impact of SVAs. This is critical for XDP pathology; removal of local heterochromatin severely aggravates the XDP molecular phenotype, resulting in increased TAF1 intron retention and reduced expression. Our results provide unique mechanistic insights into how human polymorphic transposon insertions are recognized, and their regulatory impact constrained by an innate epigenetic defense system.","Dysregulation of the striatum is linked to multiple diseases including Huntington’s (HD), Parkinson’s, X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP), addiction, autism, and schizophrenia. Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) make up 90% of the neuronal cell type in the striatum and are critical to motor control. The transcription factor Bcl11b (also known as CTIP2) is known to regulate of MSN differentiation, striatal striosome (patch) development and the architecture of the striatum during development. However, the function of Bcl11b adult striatal neurons in vivo has not been investigated. Therefore, we conditionally knocked out Bcl11b specifically in MSNs using D9-cre under the control of a regulatory elements of the mouse Ppp1r1b gene encoding DARPP-32 resulting in knockout around 5-6 weeks of age. Transcriptomic and behavioral analysis were performed on these mice.","The predominantly function of THAP1 has been defined as a transcription factor, but how it regulates gene expression in human neurons is not well understood. Here, we found that THAP1 is able to regulate the expression of alpha-synuclein (SNCA), a key protein in Parkinson’s disease (PD).","THAP1 is a transcription factor and its mutations are responsible for DYT6 dystonia. However, how THAP1 mutations lead to these gene expression alterations and whether the gene expression changes are also reflected in the brain of THAP1 patients are still unclear. In this study we used epigenetic and transcriptomic approaches combined with multiple model systems to uncover the function of THAP1 and the potential pathogenesis of DYT6 dystonia. THAP1 mutations lead to dysregulation of genes mainly through regulation of SP1 family members, SP1 and SP4, in a cell type dependent manner.","THAP1 is a transcription factor and its mutations are responsible for DYT6 dystonia.

The end-protecting activity of Shieldin promotes productive non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in G1 but can threaten genome integrity during S-phase by blocking homologous recombination (HR). Curiously, the penultimate Shieldin component, SHLD1 is one of the least abundant mammalian proteins. Here, we report that the transcription factors THAP1, YY1 and HCF1 bind directly to the SHLD1 promoter, where they cooperatively maintain the low basal expression of SHLD1. Functionally, this transcriptional network ensures that SHLD1 protein levels are kept in check to enable a proper balance between end protection and end resection during physiological DSB repair. In the context of BRCA1 deficiency, loss of THAP1 dependent SHLD1 expression confers cross resistance to PARP inhibitor and cisplatin, and shorter progression free survival in ovarian cancer patients. In contrast, loss of THAP1 in BRCA2 deficient cells increases genome instability and correlates with improved responses to chemotherapy. Pathogenic THAP1 mutations are causatively linked to adult-onset torsion dystonia type 6 (DYT6) movement disorder, but the critical disease targets are unknown. We further demonstrate that murine models of Thap1-associated dystonia show reduced Shld1 expression concomitant with elevated levels of unresolved DNA damage in the brain. In summary, our study provides the first example of a transcriptional network that directly controls DSB repair choice and reveals a previously unsuspected link between DNA damage and dystonia.","Gaucher disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, is caused by homozygous mutations at the GBA gene, which is responsible for encoding the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Neuronopathic Gaucher disease is associated with microgliosis, astrogliosis, and neurodegeneration. However, the role that microglia, astrocytes, and neurons play in the disease remains to be determined. In the current study, we developed inducible, cell-type specific Gba KO mice to understand the individual impacts of Gba deficiencies on microglia and neurons. Gba was conditionally knocked out either exclusively in microglia or neurons, or throughout the body. These mouse models were developed using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre system, with tamoxifen administration commencing at weaning. Microglia-specific Gba KO mice showed no signs of disease. However, the neuron-specific Gba KO resulted in a shortened lifespan, severe weight loss, and ataxia. These mice also had significant neurodegeneration, microgliosis, and astrogliosis accompanied by the accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, recapitulating Gaucher disease-like symptoms. These surprising findings reveal that, unlike the neuron-specific Gba deficiency, microglia-specific Gba deficiency alone does not induce disease. The neuronal Gaucher disease mouse model, with a median survival of 16 weeks, may be useful for future studies of pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapies. ","To understand the intrinsic link between PGRN and Gba D409V mutation dosage in regulating lysosomal function and disease pathogenesis, we generated nGD model of GbaD409V/D409V and loss of PGRN (Grn-/-), termed  PG9V that displayed typical neuronopathic GD (nGD). With decreasing the dose of Gba D409V, i.e., D409V/Null, in Grn KO mice (Grn-/-;GbaD409V/Null, PG9VN) led to much earlier onset and more severe neurodegenerative nGD than PG9V mice. To explore the correlation between the Gba mutation dosage and both neurodegeneration and inflammation, as well as to attain molecular insights into the underlying brain pathology in PG9VN mice, we performed bulk RNA sequencing analysis on 7.5-month-old PG9VN, PG9V and WT brain tissues containing thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain, the predominant regions displaying the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis classified similar molecular pathways were altered in both PG9V and PG9VN mice. The heightened dysregulation of these pathways may be a contributing factor to the more severe disease phenotypes observed in PG9VN mice. This dysregulation appears to be controlled by a threshold effect related to Gba dosage.","Lysosomal degradation pathways coordinate the clearance of superfluous and damaged cellular components. Compromised lysosomal degradation is a hallmark of many degenerative diseases, including lysosomal storage diseases, which are caused by loss-of-function mutations within both alleles of a lysosomal hydrolase, leading to lysosomal substrate accumulation. Gaucher’s disease, characterized by &lt;15% of normal glucocerebrosidase function, is the most common lysosomal storage disease and is a prominent risk factor for developing Parkinson’s disease. Here, we show that either of two structurally distinct small molecules that modulate PIKfyve activity, discovered from a high-throughput cellular lipid droplet clearance screen, can improve glucocerebrosidase function in Gaucher patient–derived fibroblasts through an MiT/TFE transcription factor that promotes lysosomal gene translation. An ISR antagonist used in combination with a PIKfyve modulator further improves cellular glucocerebrosidase activity, likely because integrated stress response (ISR) signaling appears to also be slightly activated by treatment by either small molecule at the higher doses employed, This strategy of combining a PIKfyve modulator with an integrated stress response inhibitor improves mutant lysosomal hydrolase function in cellular models of additional lysosomal storage diseases.","To investigate neuronopathic Gaucher disease brain cell gene expression, we established Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice and performed scRNA sequencing of whole brain cells from these and wild type mice. Unbiased clustering analysis revealed that most remarkable change between wild type and Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice was the appearance of an activated microglia cluster, which exclusively expressed Tnf. Our further study elucidated the mechanism by which activated microglia and TNF contribute to Gaucher disease pathology.","To investigate the contribution of Mincle in neuronopathic Gaucher disease, we established Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice and crossed them with Mincle deficient mice. RNA sequencing of microglia from these mice revealed Axl, a phaogocytic receptor was upregulated in Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice. In addition, Tnf was upregulated in Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice in a Mincle-dependent manner. Our further study elucidated that Mincle, Axl and TNF are involved in the pathology of Gaucher disease.","The GBA1 gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme acid-β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GBA1 mutations cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD) and are a genetic risk factor for Parkinson´s disease (PD). Many GBA1 mutations cause aberrant GCase folding and processing but how these impinge on PD pathogenesis remains unclear. We addressed GCase functions in human dopaminergic (DA) neurons derived from engineered GBA1-deficient (GBA1-/-) embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and GBA1N370S PD patient-derived induced pluripotent cells (hiPSCs). GBA1-mutant DA neurons displayed aberrant morphologies and gene expression that were rescued by recombinant GCase treatment. GBA1-/- neurons have hyperactive Calcineurin (CaN) and nuclear localization of the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB). Expression of TFEB targets and lysosomal CLEAR network components were increased in GBA1-/- DA neurons and rescued by GCase replacement and CaN inhibition. Our findings reveal a link between increased CaN activity and loss of GCase, providing a mechanism for the disturbed lysosomal/autophagy pathways in GBA1-associated PD.","Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by bi-allelic GBA1 mutations that reduce the activity of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). In the immune system, GCase deficiency deregulates signal transduction events, resulting in an inflammatory environment. It is known that the complement system promotes inflammation, and complement inhibitors are currently being considered as a novel therapy for GD; however, the mechanism by which complement drives ystemic macrophage-mediated inflammation remains incompletely understood. To help understand the mechanisms involved, we performed gene array analysis on rC5a-treated human control and GD-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophages.","Gaucher disease (GD) results from mutations in the GBA1 gene, which encodes lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GCase). The large number of mutations known to date in the gene lead to a heterogeneous disorder, which is divided into a non-neuronopathic, type 1 GD, and two neurological, type 2 and type 3, forms. We studied the two fly GBA1 orthologs, GBA1a and GBA1b. Each contains a Minos element insertion, which truncates its coding sequence. In the GBA1am/m flies, which express a mutant protein, missing 33 C-terminal amino acids, there was no decrease in GCase activity or substrate accumulation. However, GBA1bm/m mutant flies presented a significant decrease in GCase activity with concomitant substrate accumulation, which included C14:1 glucosylceramide and C14:0  glucosylsphingosine. GBA1bm/m mutant flies showed activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and presented inflammation and neuroinflammation that culminated in development of a neuronopathic disease. Treatment with ambroxol did not rescue GCase activity or reduce substrate accumulation; however, it ameliorated UPR, inflammation and neuroinflammation, and increased life span. Our results highlight the resemblance between the phenotype of the GBA1bm/m mutant fly and neuronopathic GD and underlie its relevance in further GD studies as well as a model to test possible therapeutic modalities.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Gaucher disease (GD) is currently the focus of considerable attention due primarily to the association between the gene that causes GD (GBA) and Parkinson’s disease. Mouse models exist for the systemic (type 1) and for the acute neuronopathic forms (type 2) of GD. Here we report the generation of a mouse that phenotypically models chronic neuronopathic type 3 GD. Gba-/-;Gbatg mice, which contain a Gba transgene regulated by doxycycline, accumulate moderate levels of the offending substrate in GD, glucosylceramide, and live for up to 10 months, i.e. significantly longer than mice which model type 2 GD. Gba-/-;Gbatg mice display behavioral abnormalities at ~4 months, which deteriorate with age, along with significant neuropathology including loss of Purkinje neurons. Gene expression is altered in the brain and in isolated microglia, although the changes in gene expression are less extensive than in mice modeling type 2 disease. Finally, bone deformities are consistent with the Gba-/-;Gbatg mice being a genuine type 3 GD model. Together, the Gba-/-;Gbatg mice share pathological pathways with acute neuronopathic GD mice but also display differences that might help understand the distinct disease course and progression of type 2 and 3 patients.","Gaucher disease (GD) is currently the focus of considerable attention due primarily to the association between the gene that causes GD (GBA) and Parkinson’s disease.

However, this pathway is also induced in sterile inflammation such as occurs in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD), a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by mutations in Gba1.  Mice were injected with conduritol B-epoxide, an irreversible inhibitor of acid-beta glucosidase, the enzyme defective in nGD. Quadrat deficient MyTrMaSt mice, where four adaptors of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) are deficient, were used to determine the role of the IFN pathway in nGD pathology. Activation of inflammatory and other pathways was analyzed by a variety of methods including RNAseq. Elevation in the expression of PRRs associated with the IFN response was observed in CBE-injected mice. Ablation of upstream pathways leading to IFN production had no therapeutic benefit on the lifespan of nGD mice but attenuated neuroinflammation. Primary and secondary pathological pathways, i.e. those associated or not with mouse lifespan, were distinguished, and a set of ~210 genes including those related to sphingolipid, cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism, along with a number of inflammatory pathways related to chemokines, TNF, TGF, complement, IL6 and damage associated pathogens were classified as primary pathological pathways, along with some lysosomal and neuronal genes. Although IFN signaling is the top elevated pathway in nGD, we demonstrate that this pathway is not related to mouse viability and is consequently defined as a secondary pathology pathway. By elimination, we defined a number of critical pathways that are directly related to brain pathology in nGD, which in addition to its usefulness in understanding pathophysiological mechanisms may also pave the way for development of novel therapeutic paradigms by targeting such pathways.","Purpose: In order to describe how non- genetic factors may contribute to emergence of additional neurodegenerative disorders in mice with neuronal Gaucher Disease (nGD), full transcript mRNA sequencing was implemented with half brain in order to study differential gene expression between experimental groups: (Untreated) Control, CBE (Conduritol β epoxide ), SVNI (Sindbis virus), and CBE + SVNI Methods: Full transcript mRNA sequencing was implemented with half brain in order to study differential gene expression between experimental groups (biologilal triplicates in each group). We mapped 20 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (GRCm38) and identified 16,903 transcripts. .  All subjects were 28 days old. Half of the bisected brains were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80C conditions until use. RNA was isolated using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extraction of RNA was performed at the Israeli Institute for Biological Research and the RNA was then transferred to the Weizmann Institute of Science for further analysis. Quality was examined with the Agilent 2200 TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies); RIN values of each sample were determined satisfactory for use in sequencing. Expression of mRNA was quantified using DESeq following normalization of library size with Pipeline. Gene lists were created by criteria based on an absolute linear fold change ≥ 2.0, *p ≤ 0.05. Enriched pathways in the resulting gene lists were analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Results: Our study represents the first full RNA transcriptome analysis of brains from of CBE-treated mice, with biological triplicates generated by RNA-seq technology. The CBE and CBE+SVNI conditions boast remarkably similar genetic profiles with no differentially expressed genes changed between them (fold change ≥ 2.0, *p ≤ 0.05). In CBE, SVNI, and CBE + SVNI conditions respectively, 501, 1724, and 554 genes were significantly upregulated compared to the control, while 5, 333, and 40 genes were significantly downregulated respectively (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, 476 upregulated genes in the CBE condition were shared with SVNI, while only 25 genes were uniquely upregulated. No downregulated genes were shared between the two conditions (Fig. 2C). Here, we conclude that CBE and CBE+SVNI demonstrate nearly identical mRNA profiles while SVNI boasted highly differential genes compared to all other conditions. Conclusion: Half brain mRNA profiles of 28-day old untreated (Control), CBE-treated, SVNI-treated, and SVNI + CBE-treated mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq.","Most lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) have a significant neurological component, including types 2 and 3 Gaucher disease (neuronal forms of Gaucher disease; nGD). No therapies are currently available for nGD since the recombinant enzymes used in the systemic form of Gaucher disease do not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, a number of promising approaches are currently being tested, including substrate reduction therapy (SRT), in which partial inhibition of the synthesis of the glycosphingolipids (GSLs) that accumulate in nGD lowers their accumulation. We now induce nGD in mice by injection with conduritol B-epoxide (CBE), an irreversible inhibitor of acid beta-glucosidase (GCase), the enzyme defective in nGD, with or without co-injection with GZ-667161, a prototype for SRT. Significant neuropathology, and a reduction in lifespan, was observed upon CBE injection, and this was largely reversed by co-injection with GZ-667161, along with a reduction in glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine levels. Analysis of gene expression by RNAseq revealed that GZ-667161 largely reversed the changes in genes and pathways that were differentially-expressed upon CBE injection, specifically pathways of GSL metabolism, lipoproteins and other lipid metabolic pathways, lipid droplets, astrocyte activation, neuronal function, and to some extent, neuroinflammation. Together, this demonstrates the efficacy of SRT to reverse the effects of substrate accumulation on pathological components and pathways in nGD brain.","Inherited metabolic diseases belong to the group of rare diseases (so called ‘orphan diseases’) whose incidence is less than 1: 5 000 live births. Among these diseases the lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) are also distinguished, which are caused by disorders in the lysosomal system resulting from the mutations in the genes coding for lysosomal hydrolases, cofactors, enzymes involved in the posttranslational processing, and proteins present in the lysosomal membrane.  Although about 70 LSD are recognized so far, their pathomechanism is almost unknown. Hitherto existing results of scientific investigations indicate that different cellular pathways and events are involved in the pathogenic processes: autophagy, apoptosis, toxic action of lyso- derivatives of lipid compounds, disordered  Ca2+ ions intracellular homeostasis, secondary storage of macromolecular compounds, signal transduction, inflammatory processes, deficient by-products and many more. We are especially interested in the explanation of pathomechanisms of Gaucher disease and Niemann-Pick type C disease (for the latter disease there is no therapy officially accepted). In this project we aim to experimentally explain:  - which cellular pathways and mechanisms are activated and inactivated in cells originating from patients with different LSD and healthy individuals  - are there differences in genes expression in different diseases  - are gene expression changes related to known and observed biochemical and clinical changes.","Great interest has been shown in understanding the pathology of Gaucher disease (GD) due to the recently-discovered genetic relationship with Parkinson’s disease. For such studies, suitable animal models of GD are required. Chemical induction of GD by inhibition of acid β-glucosidase (GCase) using the irreversible inhibitor, conduritol-B-epoxide (CBE), is particularly attractive, although few systematic studies examining the effect of CBE on development of symptoms associated with neurological forms of GD have been performed. We now demonstrate a correlation between the amount of CBE injected into mice and levels of accumulation of the GD substrates, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, and show that disease pathology, indicated by altered levels of pathological markers, depends on the dose of CBE and its time of injection. Gene array analysis shows a remarkable similarly in the gene expression profile of CBE-treated mice and a genetic GD mouse model, the Gbaflox/flox;nestin-Cre mouse, with 120 of the 144 genes up-regulated in CBE-treated mice also up regulated in Gbaflox/flox;nestin-Cre mice. Finally, we demonstrate that some aspects neuropathology and some behavioral abnormalities can be arrested upon cessation of CBE treatment during a specific time window. Together, our data demonstrate that injection of mice with CBE provides a rapid and relatively easy way to induce symptoms typical of neuronal forms of GD, which will prove particularly useful when examining the role of specific biochemical pathways in GD pathology, since CBE can be injected into mice defective in components of putative pathological pathways, alleviating the need for time consuming crossing of mice.","Neuroinflammation is a key phenomenon in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the mechanisms by which brain inflammation is engaged and delineating the key players in the immune response and their contribution to brain pathology is of great importance for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for these devastating diseases. Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease, is caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene and is a significant risk factor for Parkinson?s disease; in some forms of Gaucher disease, neuroinflammation is observed. An unbiased gene profile analysis was performed on a severely affected brain area of a neurological form of a Gaucher disease mouse at a pre-symptomatic stage; the mouse used for this study, the Gbaflox/flox; nestin-Cre mouse, was engineered such that GBA1 deficiency is restricted to cells of neuronal lineage, i.e., neurons and macroglia. The 10 most up-regulated genes in the ventral posteromedial/posterolateral region of the thalamus were inflammatory genes, with the gene expression signature significantly enriched in interferon signaling genes. Our results imply that the type I interferon response is involved in the development of nGD pathology, and support the notion that interferon signaling pathways play a vital role in the sterile inflammation that often occurs during chronic neurodegenerative diseases in which neuroinflammation is present.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The comparative whole genome transcriptome effects of two similar pharmaceuticals, imig or vela, on a Gaucher disease mouse model, 9V/null, were evaluated by two commonly used platforms, mRNA-Seq and microarray.

The biological pathways were similar between two platforms. Cell growth and proliferation, cell cycle, heme metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction were the most altered functions associated with the disease process.

One mechanism of this regulation is by transcriptionally activating or repressing genes encoding metabolic enzymes and transporters. This is used to wire tissue-relevant metabolic networks during development, but also to rewire metabolism upon nutritional or genetic perturbations. While many individual examples of transcriptional regulation of metabolism have been reported, a systems-level study of how metabolic gene expression responds to such perturbations is lacking in any animal. Here, we apply worm perturb-seq (WPS), a high-throughput, whole-animal RNAi/RNA-seq method, on ~900 metabolic genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, to derive a metabolic gene regulatory network (mGRN) in which the knockdown of 365 metabolic genes is connected to 9,414 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by more than 110,000 interactions. The mGRN has a highly modular structure in which distinct 22 perturbation clusters connect to 44 co-regulated gene expression programs. We uncover widespread yet highly specific responses in genes associated with stress responses and food digestion, along with various modes of transcriptional changes from simple ‘within pathway’ to complex ‘network coordination’. By integrating the mGRN with metabolic network modeling, we elucidate an underlying designing principle of transcriptional rewiring that leads us to propose a ‘compensation/repression model’ in which high-level, core metabolic functions regulate each other, likely to maintain animal homeostasis.","Gaucher disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, is caused by homozygous mutations at the GBA gene, which is responsible for encoding the enzyme glucocerebrosidase.

The neuronal Gaucher disease mouse model, with a median survival of 16 weeks, may be useful for future studies of pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapies. ","Demyelination and loss of oligodendrocytes deprives neurons of crucial metabolic and trophic support and contributes to neurodegeneration. However, the precise mechanisms that trigger neurodegeneration during demyelination remain unclear. Here, we examine transcriptional differences in neurons that have been demyelinated relative to myelinated neurons. Demyelination is induced by the knockout of Myrf, a transcription factor essential for myelin gene expression and oligodendrocyte identity, from oligodendrocyte lineage cells using Myrffl/fl Sox10 CreERT mice. We performed laser capture microdissection of the ganglion cell layer, which contains the majority of the retinal ganglion cells (RGC), a nearly ubiquitously myelinated population of neurons. We find that dissection of the ganglion cell layer greatly enriches for RGC transcripts relative to controls.  Demyelinated Myrffl/fl Sox10 CreERT mice have upregulation of Hrk and Ecel1 in the ganglion cell layer, which are known to be upregulated during axonal injury and driven by dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) signaling. These data suggest that demyelination may activate a DLK-mediated signaling cascade that culminates in transcriptional changes that are often associated with apoptosis of neurons in the central nervous system.","To understand the intrinsic link between PGRN and Gba D409V mutation dosage in regulating lysosomal function and disease pathogenesis, we generated nGD model of GbaD409V/D409V and loss of PGRN (Grn-/-), termed  PG9V that displayed typical neuronopathic GD (nGD).

To explore the correlation between the Gba mutation dosage and both neurodegeneration and inflammation, as well as to attain molecular insights into the underlying brain pathology in PG9VN mice, we performed bulk RNA sequencing analysis on 7.5-month-old PG9VN, PG9V and WT brain tissues containing thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain, the predominant regions displaying the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis classified similar molecular pathways were altered in both PG9V and PG9VN mice. The heightened dysregulation of these pathways may be a contributing factor to the more severe disease phenotypes observed in PG9VN mice.

Here we characterize the prevalence and functional consequences of microRNA tailing in vivo, using Caenorhabditis elegans. MicroRNA tailing in C. elegans consists mostly of mono-uridylation of mature microRNA species, with rarer mono-adenylation which is likely added to microRNA precursors. Through a targeted RNAi screen, we discover that the TUT4/TUT7 gene family member CID-1/CDE-1/PUP-1 is required for uridylation, whereas the GLD2 gene family member F31C3.2-here named GLD-2-related 2 (GLDR-2)-is required for adenylation. Thus, the TUT4/TUT7 and GLD2 gene families have broadly conserved roles in miRNA modification. We specifically examine the role of tailing in microRNA turnover. We determine half-lives of microRNAs after acute inactivation of microRNA biogenesis, revealing that half-lives are generally long (median = 20.7 h), as observed in other systems. Although we observe that the proportion of tailed species increases over time after biogenesis, disrupting tailing does not alter microRNA decay. Thus, tailing is not a global regulator of decay in C. elegans. Nonetheless, by identifying the responsible enzymes, this study lays the groundwork to explore whether tailing plays more specialized context- or miRNA-specific regulatory roles.","Ethylene glycol (EG) is a widely used industrial chemical with manifold applications and is also generated in the degradation of plastics such as PET. Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 (RHA1), a potential biocatalytic chassis, grows on EG. Transcriptomic analyses revealed four clusters of genes potentially involved in EG catabolism: the mad locus, predicted to encode mycofactocin-dependent alcohol degradation, including the catabolism of EG to glycolate; two GCL clusters, predicted to encode glycolate and glyoxylate catabolism; and the mft genes, predicted to specify mycofactocin biosynthesis. Bioinformatic analyses further revealed that the mad and mft genes are widely distributed in mycolic acid-producing bacteria such as RHA1. Neither ΔmadA nor ΔmftC RHA1 mutant strains grew on EG but grew on acetate. In resting cell assays, the ΔmadA mutant depleted glycolaldehyde but not EG from culture media. These results indicate that madA encodes a mycofactocin-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase that initiates EG catabolism. In contrast to some mycobacterial strains, the mad genes did not appear to enable RHA1 to grow on methanol as sole substrate. Finally, a strain of RHA1 adapted to grow ~3× faster on EG contained an overexpressed gene, aldA2, predicted to encode an aldehyde dehydrogenase. When incubated with EG, this strain accumulated lower concentrations of glycolaldehyde than RHA1. Moreover, ecotopically expressed aldA2 increased RHA1’s tolerance for EG further suggesting that glycolaldehyde accumulation limits growth of RHA1 on EG. Overall, this study provides insights into the bacterial catabolism of small alcohols and aldehydes and facilitates the engineering of Rhodococcus for the upgrading of plastic waste streams.","Protein-RNA regulatory networks underpin much of biology. C. elegans FBF-2, a PUF RNA-binding protein, binds over 1000 RNAs to govern stem cells and differentiation. FBF-2 interacts with multiple protein partners via a key tyrosine, Y479. Here we investigate the in vivo significance of partnerships using a Y479A mutant. Y479A occupancy increases or decreases at specific sites across the transcriptome, varying with the RNA, and shifts from 3’UTRs to other regions. Germline development also changes in a very specific fashion: Y479A abolishes one FBF-2 function – the sperm to oocyte cell fate switch. Y479A changes to regulation of one mRNA, gld-1, are critical to this fate change, though other network changes are also important. FBF-2 switches from repression to activation of gld-1 RNA, likely by distinct FBF-2 partnerships. The role of partnerships in governing RNA regulatory networks will extend broadly, including for human health and disease, as protein partnerships pervade RNA control. ","Effects of tryptophan derived-betaxanthins in C. elegans  Jk1466 strain gene expression is studied. Microarrays were used to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the lifespan extension and identified distinct classes of up/down-regulated genes in animal treated with tryptophan-derived betaxanthins","Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) are a rare population of cells specified early in embryonic development that give rise to gametes - sperm and egg cells. Current in vitro systems to derive PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) from pluripotent cells use large embryoid bodies, exposed to signalling cocktails, that do not recapitulate the native embryonic environment during PGC formation. Here we show that mouse gastruloids, three-dimensional in vitro models of gastrulation, generate a population of Gastruloid-derived PGC-like cells (Gld-PGCLCs) that resemble early PGCs in vivo. Importantly, the conserved organisation of mouse gastruloids leads to coordinated spatial and temporal localisation of Gld-PGCLCs relative to surrounding somatic cells, even in the absence of exogenous PGC-specific signalling or extraembryonic tissues. In gastruloids, self-organised interactions between cells and tissues, including the endodermal epithelium, enables the specification, migration, and subsequent maturation of a pool of Gld-PGCLCs. As such, mouse gastruloids represent a new source of PGCLCs in vitro and, due to their inherent co-development, serve as a novel model of dynamic PGC development within integrated tissue environments.","Metabolic rewiring is essential for breast tumor growth and progression to metastatic disease, yet little is known regarding how cancer cells modify their acquired metabolic programs in response to different metastatic microenvironments. Transcriptional and metabolomic analysis have previously shown that liver-metastatic breast cancer cells adopt an intrinsic metabolic profile characterized by increased HIF-1α activity and dependence on glycolysis. Stable isotope tracing analysis (SITA) performed in vivo confirmed that the glycolytic nature of liver-metastatic breast cancer cells is retained when these cells are grown as primary tumors or as liver metastases. However, our data also reveal that unique metabolic adaptations are specifically induced by the liver microenvironment. Indeed, liver metastases display elevated expression of genes involved in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification when compared to primary tumors. Moreover, breast cancer liver metastases rely strongly on glucose and glutamine-derived carbons to support de novo GSH synthesis. Glutathione is a tripeptide that acts as a major scavenger for reactive oxygen species (ROS). Liver metastases display reduced levels of 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, confirming their increased capacity to buffer ROS. We demonstrated the dependence of liver metastases formation on these distinct metabolic adaptations by depleting glutamate-cysteine ligase (Gcl), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis. Gcl depletion, and decreased GSH levels, strongly reduced the capacity of liver-metastatic cells to form distant metastasis within the liver. We performed gene expression analysis of liver metastasis and primary tumors from liver-metastatic breast cancer cells derived from 4T1 cells. 4T1-2776 (76) and 4T1-2792 (92) cells were injected in the mammary fat pads of BALB/c and grown as primary tumors or were grown as liver metastasis after splenic injection. Tissues were harvested from primary tumors and liver metastasis and submitted to laser-capture microdissection (LCM). For liver metastasis, tumour tissue was harvested at 10 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks after splenic injection. For each time point, tissue was isolated from the tumor centre (core), a peripheral area of the tumor (margin), a region of the liver proximal to the tumor (adjacent) and a region of the liver far from the tumor (distant). For primary tumors from 4T1-2776 cells (1034, 1036, 1043) and 4T1-2792 (MFP2L, MFP3L, MFP5L) tissue was collected from the tumor core and margin, at the experimental endpoint.","Gene expression profile at single cell level of CD45+ cells isolated from wildtype (twi littermate) mouse brain (postnatal day 21) to evaluate and compare differences in immune cells at the onset of spontaneous clinical disease in a mouse model of globoid cell leukodystrophy.","To investigate neuronopathic Gaucher disease brain cell gene expression, we established Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice and performed scRNA sequencing of whole brain cells from these and wild type mice. Unbiased clustering analysis revealed that most remarkable change between wild type and Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice was the appearance of an activated microglia cluster, which exclusively expressed Tnf. Our further study elucidated the mechanism by which activated microglia and TNF contribute to Gaucher disease pathology.","To investigate the contribution of Mincle in neuronopathic Gaucher disease, we established Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice and crossed them with Mincle deficient mice. RNA sequencing of microglia from these mice revealed Axl, a phaogocytic receptor was upregulated in Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice. In addition, Tnf was upregulated in Gba flox/flox; Nestin-Cre mice in a Mincle-dependent manner. Our further study elucidated that Mincle, Axl and TNF are involved in the pathology of Gaucher disease.","The GBA1 gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme acid-β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GBA1 mutations cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD) and are a genetic risk factor for Parkinson´s disease (PD). Many GBA1 mutations cause aberrant GCase folding and processing but how these impinge on PD pathogenesis remains unclear. We addressed GCase functions in human dopaminergic (DA) neurons derived from engineered GBA1-deficient (GBA1-/-) embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and GBA1N370S PD patient-derived induced pluripotent cells (hiPSCs). GBA1-mutant DA neurons displayed aberrant morphologies and gene expression that were rescued by recombinant GCase treatment. GBA1-/- neurons have hyperactive Calcineurin (CaN) and nuclear localization of the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB). Expression of TFEB targets and lysosomal CLEAR network components were increased in GBA1-/- DA neurons and rescued by GCase replacement and CaN inhibition. Our findings reveal a link between increased CaN activity and loss of GCase, providing a mechanism for the disturbed lysosomal/autophagy pathways in GBA1-associated PD.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Whole starved L1 larvae were collected with and without AMA-1 degradation by the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system in the soma and germ line between 36 and 132 hours of starvation along with controls.","We present a new approach, Light-Seq, for multiplexed spatial indexing of intact biological samples using light-directed DNA barcoding in fixed cells and tissues followed by ex situ sequencing. Light-Seq combines spatially-targeted, rapid photocrosslinking of DNA barcodes onto cDNAs in situ with a novel one-step DNA stitching reaction to create pooled, spatially-indexed sequencing libraries. This light-directed barcoding enables in situ selection of multiple cell populations in intact fixed tissue samples for full transcriptome sequencing based on location, morphology, or protein stains, without cellular dissociation. Applying Light-Seq to mouse retinal sections, we recovered thousands of differentially enriched transcripts from three adjacent cellular layers and discovered new biomarkers for a very rare neuronal subtype, dopaminergic amacrine cells, from only 4-8 individual cells per section. Light-Seq provides an accessible workflow to combine in situ imaging and protein staining with next-generation sequencing of the same cells, leaving the sample intact sample for further analysis post-sequencing.","we identified gene-expression changes in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) from a patients with GLD (K-iPSCs/NSCs) and normal control (AF-iPSCs/NSCs), in order to investigate the potential mechanism underlying GLD pathogenesis. We identified 194 (K-iPSCs vs. AF-iPSCs) and 702 (K-NSCs vs. AF-NSCs) significantly dysregulated mRNAs when comparing the indicated groups. We also identified dozens of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway terms that were enriched for the differentially expressed genes.","Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by bi-allelic GBA1 mutations that reduce the activity of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). In the immune system, GCase deficiency deregulates signal transduction events, resulting in an inflammatory environment. It is known that the complement system promotes inflammation, and complement inhibitors are currently being considered as a novel therapy for GD; however, the mechanism by which complement drives ystemic macrophage-mediated inflammation remains incompletely understood. To help understand the mechanisms involved, we performed gene array analysis on rC5a-treated human control and GD-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophages.","Gene expression profile at single cell level of CD45+ cells isolated from wildtype (twi littermate) mouse brain (postnatal day 21) to evaluate and compare differences in immune cells at the onset of spontaneous clinical disease in a mouse model of globoid cell leukodystrophy.","we identified gene-expression changes in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) from a patients with GLD (K-iPSCs/NSCs) and normal control (AF-iPSCs/NSCs), in order to investigate the potential mechanism underlying GLD pathogenesis.

It is characterized by distinctive facial features, brachydactyly, sleep disturbances and stereotypic behaviors. We investigated a cohort of 15 individuals with a clinical suspicion of SMS, who showed neither deletion in the SMS critical region nor damaging variants in RAI1. Potentially deleterious variants were identified in nine of these subjects using whole-exome sequencing. Eight of these changes affect KMT2D, ZEB2, MAP2K2, GLDC, CASK, MECP2, KDM5C and POGZ, known to be associated with Kabuki syndrome 1, Mowat-Wilson syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, glycine encephalopathy, mental retardation and microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia, X-linked mental retardation 13, X-linked mental retardation Claes-Jensen type and White-Sutton syndrome, respectively. The ninth individual carries a de novo variant in JAKMIP1, a regulator of neuronal translation that was recently found deleted in a patient with autism spectrum disorder. Analyses of coexpression and biomedical text mining suggest that these pathologies and SMS are part of the same disease network. Further support for this hypothesis was obtained from transcriptome profiling that showed that the expression levels of both Zeb2 and Map2k2 are perturbed in Rai1-/- mice. As an orthogonal approach to potentially contributory disease gene variants, we used chromatin conformation capture to reveal chromatin contacts between RAI1 and the loci flanking ZEB2 and GLDC, as well as between RAI1 and human orthologs of the genes that show perturbed expression in our Rai1-/- mouse model. These holistic studies of RAI1 and its interactions allow insights into SMS and other disorders associated with intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities. Our findings support a pan-genomic approach to the molecular diagnosis of a distinctive disorder.","Treatment of monogenic disorders has historically relied on symptomatic management with limited ability to target primary molecular deficits. However, recent advances in gene therapy and related technologies aim to correct these underlying deficiencies, raising the possibility of disease management or even prevention for diseases that can be treated pre-symptomatically. Tay–Sachs disease (TSD) would be one such candidate, however very little is known about the presymptomatic stage of TSD. To better understand the effects of TSD on brain development, we evaluated the transcriptomes of human fetal brain samples with biallelic pathogenic variants in HEXA. We identified dramatic changes in the transcriptome, suggesting a perturbation of normal development. We also observed a shift in the expression of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway away from production of the HEXA substrate, GM2 ganglioside, presumptively to compensate for dysfunction of the enzyme. However, we do not observe transcriptomic signatures of end-stage disease, suggesting that developmental perturbations precede neurodegeneration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the relationship between fetal disease pathology in juvenile onset TSD and the analysis of gene expression in fetal TSD tissues. This study highlights the need to better understand the “pre-symptomatic” stage of disease to set realistic expectations for patients receiving early therapeutic intervention.","Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a inherited lysosomal storage disease resulting from mutations in the α-subunits of the lysosomal enzyme, β-hexosaminidase A, and leads to excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. This disease can be presented in infantil, juvenil and adult forms with rapid, progressive neurodegeneration. Although the link between mTOR and autophagy in Taysachs diseases has not been previously examined, it is reasonably to infer that reduced activity of HexA and the consequent intracellular accumulation of undegraded ganglyosides could lead accumulation of lysosomes, other substrates or dysfunctional organelles, similar to other defects detected in other LSD.  In the present study, we show that skin fibroblasts derived from PLS patients presented increased p62/SQSTM1 expression levels and autophagosome accumulation suggesting an impaired autophagic flux.","Sandhoff disease, one of the GM2 gangliosidoses, is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the absence of b-hexosaminidase A and B activity and the concomitant lysosomal accumulation of its substrate, GM2 ganglioside. It features catastrophic neurodegeneration and death in early childhood. How the lysosomal accumulation of ganglioside might affect the early development of the nervous system is not understood. Recently, cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have illuminated early developmental events altered by disease processes. To develop an early neurodevelopmental model of Sandhoff disease, we first generated iPS cells from the fibroblasts of an infantile Sandhoff disease patient, then corrected one of the mutant HEXB alleles in those iPS cells with CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, thereby creating isogenic controls. Next, we used the parental Sandhoff disease iPS cells and isogenic HEXB-corrected iPS cell clones to generate cerebral organoids that modeled the first trimester of neurodevelopment. The Sandhoff disease organoids but not the HEXB-corrected organoids accumulated GM2 ganglioside, and exhibited increased size and cellular proliferation compared with the HEXB-corrected organoids. Whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrated that development was impaired in the Sandhoff disease organoids, suggesting that alterations in neuronal differentiation may occur during early development in the GM2 gangliosidoses","Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is a rare, genetic, lysosomal disorder with progressive neurodegeneration. Poor understanding of the pathophysiology and lack of blood-based diagnostic markers are major hurdles in the treatment and management of NPC and several additional neurological, lysosomal disorders. To identify disease severity correlates, we undertook whole genome expression profiling of sentinel organs, brain, liver, and spleen of Balb/c Npc1-/- mice (Npc1nih)relative to Npc1+/- at an asymptomatic stage, as well as early- and late-symptomatic stages.  Unexpectedly, we found prominent up regulation of innate immunity genes with age-dependent change in their expression, in all three organs. We shortlisted a set of 12 secretory genes whose expression steadily increased with age in both brain and liver, as potential plasma correlates for the neurological disease. Ten were innate immune genes with eight ascribed to lysosomes. Several are known to be elevated in diseased organs of murine models of other lysosomal diseases including Gaucher’s disease, Sandhoff disease and MPSIIIB. We validated the top candidate lysozyme, in the plasma of Npc1-/- as well as Balb/c Npc1nmf164 mice (bearing a point mutation closer to human disease mutants) and show its reduction in response to an emerging therapeutic. We further established elevation of innate immunity in Npc1-/- mice through multiple functional assays including inhibition of bacterial infection as well as cellular analysis and immunohistochemistry. We used microarrays on the diseased organs, brain, liver and spleen of the Npc1-/- mice  to unserstand the molecular changes occur during the progression of NPC diseases. From the data, we have identified 12 potential genes which can be potentially developed as blood-based biomarker. We have also discovered up regulation of innate iimunity genes in all three organs of Npc1-/- mice and functionally validated them in liver and spleen.","Analysis of spleen across 3 age groups of Npc1−/− Balb/c females with Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease.

Ccl3 gene expression is elevated in the CNS and visceral tissue of many lysosomal storage disorders. The deletion of Ccl3 in a mouse model of Sandhoff disease was reported to result in reduced monocyte-associated pathology in the brain, delayed neurodegeneration, and prolonged health. However, deletion of Ccl3 in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick C disease was dentrimental or neutral instead of beneficial. Prevention of neuronal loss was instead mediated by providing NPC1 to neurons. We used microarrays to detail the global change in gene expression of the cerebellum in Niemann-Pick C disease animals, Niemann-Pick C disease animals with Ccl3 gene deletion, and Niemann-Pick C disease animals with Purkinje neuron-specific NPC1-YFP rescue.","Sandhoff disease (SD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the absence of β-hexosaminidase and storage of GM2 ganglioside and related glycolipids. We found the alterations in the thymus during the development of mild to severe progressive neurologic disease. To elucidate the molecular basis of thymic involution, we performed cDNA microarray analysis to identify the changes in gene expression that accompanied the involution of the thymus. 8018 probes were found to be relatively increased in the thymus of the Hexb-/- mice, an animal model for SD, compared with that of the Hexb+/- mice. On the other hand, the expression of 7604 probes was relatively decreased. The cohort of up-regulated sequences was dominated by genes that play a role in the immune response. In addition, some of these genes are expressed in macrophage lineages such as macrophage expressed gene 1, and colony stimulating factor 2 receptor beta 1. Th2 cytokines were mostly upregulated in the Hexb-/- mice, although Th1 cytokines did not show this increase. In addition, B cell related genes such as CD19, CXCL13 were increased, whereas the T cell-related genes were mostly decreased, in Hexb-/- mice compared with Hexb+/- mice.","To investigate SLC7A11 inhibition-induced ferroptosis in LDHB-deficient lung cancer cells requires glutaminolysis","Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are emerging as powerful regulators of various biological processes, but the underlying epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of these molecules in cholesterol homeostasis remain elusive.

Two alternative splice isoforms of MALT1 (ISO A and ISO B) are conserved within vertebrae, which differ in the presence of exon 7 (MALT1 ISO A). We show by isoform-specific reconstitution of MALT1-deficient CD4-positive T cells that MALT1 ISO A mediates additional functions in T cell activation. Transcriptome-wide analysis revealed a distinct subset of genes specifically upregulated in presence of exon 7.","The goals and objectives for this study are to determine whether AAV containing TLR9 inhibitory oligonucleotide sequences (AAV-hSPBTLR9i) can mitigate the immune response sufficiently to redose AAV in the lungs and prolong the survival of SP-B deficient mice.","To elucidate the function of calcineurin in dendritic cells (DCs) downstream of C-type lectin receptor, we established mouse model that has DC-specific calcineurin deficiency. We stimulated the bone marrow-derived DCs from these mice with lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a ligand of Dectin-2, and performed RNA sequencing. From multiple genes that showed altered expression pattern in calcineurin-deficient DCs, we found that Il10 transcription increased in the absence of calcineurin. Our further study elucidated the mechanism by which calcineurin regulates Il10 transcription in LAM activated DCs.","Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant condition, is engendered by heterozygous mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 genes, manifesting in systemic growth of benign tumors. In addition to brain lesions, neurologic sequelae represent the greatest morbidity in TSC patients. Investigations utilizing TSC1/2-knockout animal or human stem cell models suggest that TSC deficiency-causing hyper-activation of mTOR signaling might precipitate anomalous neurodevelopmental processes. However, how the pathogenic variants of TSC1/2 genes identified in TSC patients affect the trajectory of human brain development and how they contribute to the neurological manifestations in TSC remain largely unexplored. Here, we employed 3-dimensional cortical organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from TSC patients harboring TSC2 mutations, alongside organoids from age- and sex-matched healthy individuals as controls. Through comprehensively longitudinal molecular and cellular analysis of TSC organoids, including transcriptomics and single cell transcriptomics, we found that TSC2 pathogenic variants led to dysregulated neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and gliogenesis, particularly for reactive astrogliosis. The altered developmental trajectory of TSC organoids significantly resembles the molecular signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Through cell-cell communication analysis at the single cell level, we identified that TSC2 pathogenic variants disrupted the cell-cell communications, in particular, neuron-astrocyte interactions within the NLGN-NRXN signaling network.

MRL/lpr mice, which develop SLE-like autoimmunity due to defective apoptosis in activated B and T cells, were used to study the role of apoptosis in autoimmunity. We generated Faslpr mice deficient in EAF2, a transcription elongation-associated factor known to promote apoptosis in germinal center (GC) B cells and crucial for preventing autoimmunity. Contrary to expectations, EAF2 deficiency significantly reduced lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, extended lifespan, and alleviated nephritis by decreasing autoantibody production and reducing immune complex deposition in the kidneys. Additionally, EAF2 deficiency markedly reduced accumulation of activated B cells, GC B cells, and plasma cells in Faslpr mice. Moreover, the abnormal B220+CD3+ T cells typically observed in Faslpr mice were substantially reduced by EAF2 deficiency. Further analysis revealed that Eaf2-/-Faslpr B cells showed hyperactivation upon various stimulations, followed by increased death. RNA sequencing of the B220+CD3+ cells revealed a downregulation in survival-promoting genes such as Bcl-2 and Akt and an upregulation of proapoptotic genes. We conclude that the combined deficiency in FAS- and EAF2-mediated apoptotic pathways leads to B cell hyperactivation and subsequent death, thereby ameliorating systemic autoimmunity in this model.","Circadian neurons within animal brains orchestrate myriad physiological processes and behaviors, but the contribution of these neurons to the regulation of sleep is not well understood. To address this deficiency, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a new and now comprehensive census of transcriptomic cell types of Drosophila clock neurons. We focused principally on the enigmatic DN3s, which constitute most fly brain clock neurons and were previously almost completely uncharacterized. These DN3s are organized into 12 clusters with unusual gene expression features compared to the more well-studied clock neurons. We further show that previously uncharacterized DN3 subtypes promote sleep through a G protein–coupled receptor, TrissinR. Our findings indicate an intricate regulation of sleep behavior by clock neurons and highlight their remarkable diversity in gene expression and functional properties.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health problem worldwide, ranging from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to the more severe metabolic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although many studies have elucidated the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epigenetic regulatory mechanism from NAFL to NASH remains incompletely understood. The histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, MLL4 (also called KMT2D), is a critical epigenetic transcriptional coactivator that mediates overnutrition-induced steatosis in mice, but its potential role in the progression of NASH remains largely unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking the one allele of the Mll4 gene are resistant to hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH conditions compared to wild-type controls. Transcriptome analysis of the livers of control and Mll4+/- mice identified pro-inflammatory genes regulated by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway as major target genes of MLL4. We show that MLL4 binds to p65 and that MLL4 is required for NF-κB transactivation. Myeloid-specific Mll4 knockout mice showed an almost complete block of NASH, while hepatocyte-specific Mll4 knockout mice showed mild inhibition of steatosis. Pro-inflammatory M1 polarization is decreased and anti-inflammatory M2 polarization is increased in liver macrophages from myeloid-specific Mll4 knockout mice. Importantly, we show that histone H3-lysine 4 methylation mediated by the MLL4-complex plays a critical role in promoting the expression of Ccl2 in hepatocytes and M1 marker genes in macrophages. Our results demonstrate that MLL4, through the NF-κB-MLL4 regulatory axis, exacerbates steatohepatitis in the context of an inflammatory response and represents a potential therapeutic target for NASH.","Melanoma arises from transformation of melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis where they are surrounded by keratinocytes, with which they interact through cell contact and paracrine communication. Although research focuses on how the accumulation of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations in melanocytes drive melanoma development, how alterations in keratinocytes serve as extrinsic drivers of melanoma initiation and progression is poorly understood. We recently identified keratinocyte desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) as an important mediator of keratinocyte:melanoma crosstalk. Here we address the extent to which Dsg1 loss, which occurs in response to acute environmental stress such as ultraviolet radiation, affects early steps in melanomagenesis. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that paracrine signals from Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes mediate a transcriptional switch from a differentiated to undifferentiated cell state in melanocytes expressing BRAFV600E. Of 221 differentially expressed genes in BRAFV600E cells treated with Dsg1-deficient conditioned media (CM), the laminin superfamily member NTN4/Netrin-4, which inhibits senescence in endothelial cells, stood out. Indeed, while BRAFV600E melanocytes treated with Dsg1-deficient CM showed signs of senescence bypass, knockdown of NTN4 reversed these effects. These results suggest that Dsg1 loss in keratinocytes provides an extrinsic signal to push melanocytes towards oncogenic transformation once an initial mutation has been introduced.","Although mutations in human patatin-like phospholipase PNPLA6 are associated with hereditary retinal degenerative diseases, its mechanistic action in the retina is poorly understood. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism by which PNPLA6 dysfunction disturbs retinal homeostasis and visual function. PNPLA6, by acting as a phospholipase B, regulates choline mobilization from phosphatidylcholine and subsequent choline turnover for phosphatidylcholine regeneration in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. PNPLA6-driven choline is supplied from RPE cells to adjacent photoreceptor cells to support their survival. Inhibition of this pathway results in abnormal morphology, proliferation, metabolism, and functions of RPE and photoreceptor cells, and mice with retina-specific PNPLA6 deletion exhibit retinitis pigmentosa-like retinal degeneration. Notably, these abnormalities are entirely rescued by choline supplementation. Thus, PNPLA6 plays an essential role in retinal homeostasis by controlling choline availability for phospholipid recycling and provide a framework for the development of a novel ophthalmic drug target for retinal degeneration.","Somatic mutations in ARID1A (AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A) are present in approximately 25% of bladder cancers (BC) and are associated with poor prognosis. With a view to discover effective treatment options for ARID1A-deficient BC patients, we set out to identify targetable effectors dysregulated consequent to ARID1A deficiency. Integrative analyses of ARID1A depletion in normal organoids and data mining in publicly available datasets revealed upregulation of DNA repair and cell cycle-associated genes consequent to loss of ARID1A and identified CHEK1 (Checkpoint kinase 1) and chromosomal passenger complex member BIRC5 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 5) as therapeutically drug-able candidate molecular effectors. Ex vivo treatment of patient-derived BC tumoroids with clinically advanced small molecule inhibitors targeting CHEK1 or BIRC5 was associated with increased DNA damage signalling and apoptosis, and selectively induced cell death in tumoroids lacking ARID1A protein expression.  Thus, integrating public datasets with patient-derived organoid modelling and ex-vivo drug testing can uncover key molecular effectors and mechanisms of oncogenic transformation, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies. Our data point to ARID1A protein expression as a suitable candidate biomarker for the selection of BC patients responsive to therapies targeting BIRC5 and CHEK1.","Transcription factor Pax5 activates genes essential for B-cell development and function. However, the regulation of Pax5 expression remains elusive. Adaptor Rack1 can interact with multiple transcription factors and modulate their activation and/or stability. Despite that, its role in the transcriptional control of B-cell fates is largely unknown. Here we show that CD19-driven Rack1 deficiency leads to pro-B accumulation and simultaneous reduction of B cells at later developmental stages. The generation of bone marrow chimeras indicates a cell-intrinsic role of Rack1 in B-cell homeostasis. Moreover, Rack1 augments BCR and TLR signaling in mature B cells. Based on diminished CD19 expression upon Rack1 deficiency, further exploration reveals that Rack1 maintains Pax5 protein levels through direct interaction and consequent prevention of Pax5 ubiquitination. Accordingly, Mb1-driven Rack1 deficiency almost completely blocks B-cell development at the pro-B cell stage. Thus, Rack1 regulates B-cell development and function through, at least partially, binding to and stabilizing Pax5.","RIF1 is a multifunctional protein that promotes immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype diversification. Whether RIF1 plays additional roles in adaptive immunity is unknown. In this study, we observed an upregulation of RIF1 expression following mature B cell activation, while its deficiency led to a deregulated expression profile enriched in genes typically expressed in B cell progenitors and plasma cells (PC). RIF1 ablation resulted in increased plasmablast formation ex vivo and enhanced terminal differentiation into PC upon immunization. Therefore, RIF1 serves as a cell identity gatekeeper during late B cell differentiation, providing an additional layer of control in the establishment of humoral immunity.","Plants have evolved a tightly regulated and inducible immune system to resist pathogen attack. After the initial contact with the pathogen, plants are significantly more resistant to future challenges, even from unrelated pathogens, an event known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In plants polyamines are involved in the regulation and establishment of the defense response by modulating their metabolism, specifically their biosynthesis, conjugation and catabolism. However, it is not known whether polyamine transport is involved in the plant defense response. Herein, we demonstrate that the PUT2/LAT4 transporter is required to establish local immunity and systemic defense responses in the A. thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) pathosystem. Our data revealed a dual phenotype in the put2-1 mutant after Pst inoculation, on one side, SAR was abolished in the systemic leaves while on the other, basal resistance to Pst was enhanced. Remarkably, this phenotype persisted even upon inoculation with unrelated pathogens such as Botrytis cinerea, highlighting a broad-spectrum SAR deficiency. To gain deeper insights into the involvement of PA transport in SAR, transcriptomic and metabolomic data of the put2-1 mutant were obtained.","Nucleic acid sensing by endolysosomal TLR7-9 results in the induction of antiviral and proinflammatory transcriptional responses. We recently identified TASL as the innate immune adaptor mediating TLR7-9-induced IRF5 activation via the interaction with SLC15A4, but its relevance in primary murine cells remained unexplored. Here we assessed the impact of deficiency in TASL and/or its previously uncharacterized paralogue Gm6377, named here TASL2, on endolysosomal TLR responses in primary bone-marrow-derived pDCs and splenic B cells. Double knockout TASLxTASL2 (TASLDKO) phenocopied the strong impairement observed in cells from SLC15A4-deficient feeble mice, while single TASL or TASL2 deficiency showed partial effect. Altogether, this study demonstrates that the SLC15A4-TASL/TASL2 complex play a critical role for TLR7-9-driven inflammatory responses.","The enzyme transport vehicle (ETV:IDS) is a lysosomal enzyme fused to iduronate 2-sulfatase (ETV:IDS), the lysosomal enzyme deficient in mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II). ETV:IDS treatment significantly improved brain delivery of IDS in a preclinical model of disease, enabling enhanced distribution to neurons, astrocytes, and microglia throughout the brain. Improved brain exposure for ETV:IDS translated to a significant reduction in accumulated substrates in these CNS cell types and peripheral tissues, and in a complete correction of downstream disease-relevant pathologies in the brain, including secondary accumulation of lysosomal lipids, perturbed gene expression, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of the ETV approach as a new treatment paradigm for MPS II and for other CNS diseases more broadly.","Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are a group of about 50 metabolic disorders, sharing the inability to degrade specific endolysosomal substrates. This results in failure of cellular functions in many organ systems including brain in most patients, which show a progressive neurodegeneration. In this study we performed an RNA-Seq analysis of two brain areas (cerebral cortex and midbrain/diencephalon/hippocampus) of the mouse model for Mucopolysaccharidosis type II, a neurodegenerative LSD.","Establishment of a transcriptomic profile of human cells treated with genistein with particular emphasis on signature of genes coding for enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis stands for the present study. The hypothesis tested was that indomethacin and nimesulide influence expression of some genes among which are those coding for enzymes required for synthesis of different GAGs being pathologically accumulated in mucopolysaccharidoses. Results provide important information concerning the extent of action of indomethacin and nimesulide at the molecular level in terms of modulation of gene expression by these substances.","Huntington’s disease (HD) and juvenile-onset schizophrenia (SCZ) have long been regarded as distinct disorders. However, both manifest cell-intrinsic abnormalities in glial differentiation, with resultant astrocytic dysfunction and hypomyelination. To assess whether a common mechanism might underlie the similar glial pathology of these otherwise disparate conditions, we utilized comparative correlation network approaches to analyze RNA-seq data from human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) produced from disease-derived pluripotent stem cells. We identified gene sets preserved between HD and SCZ hGPCs yet distinct from normal controls, that included 174 highly-connected genes in the shared disease-associated network, focused on genes involved in synaptic signaling. These synaptic genes were largely suppressed in both SCZ and HD hGPCs, and gene regulatory network analysis identified a core set of upstream regulators of this network, of which OLIG2 and TCF7L2 were prominent. Among their downstream targets, ADGRL3, a modulator of glutamatergic synapses, was notably suppressed in both SCZ and HD hGPCs. ChIP-seq confirmed that OLIG2 and TCF7L2 each bound to the regulatory region of ADGRL3, whose expression was then rescued by lentiviral overexpression of these transcription factors. These data suggest that the disease-associated suppression of OLIG2 and TCF7L2-dependent transcription of glutamate signaling regulators may impair glial receptivity to neuronal glutamate. The consequent loss of activity-dependent mobilization of hGPCs may yield deficient oligodendrocyte production, and hence the hypomyelination noted in these disorders, as well as the disrupted astrocytic differentiation and attendant synaptic dysfunction associated with each. Together, these data highlight the importance of convergent glial molecular pathology in both the pathogenesis and phenotypic similarities of two otherwise unrelated disorders, HD and SCZ.","Huntington’s disease (HD) and juvenile-onset schizophrenia (SCZ) have long been regarded as distinct disorders.

Microglia infiltrate the neuroepithelium early in embryonic development and are maintained in the brain throughout adulthood. Several maternal environmental factors, such as aberrant microbiome, immune activation, and poor nutrition, can influence prenatal brain development. Nevertheless, it is unknown how changes in the prenatal environment instruct the developmental trajectory of infiltrating microglia, which in turn affect brain development and function. Here we show that after maternal immune activation (MIA) microglia from the offspring have a long-lived decrease in immune reactivity (blunting) across the developmental trajectory. The blunted immune response was concomitant with changes in the chromatin accessibility and reduced transcription factor occupancy of the open chromatin. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that MIA does not induce a distinct subpopulation but rather decreases the contribution to inflammatory microglia states. Prenatal replacement of MIA microglia with physiological infiltration of naïve microglia ameliorated the immune blunting and restored a decrease in presynaptic vesicle release probability onto dopamine receptor type-two medium spiny neurons, indicating that aberrantly formed microglia due to an adverse prenatal environment impacts the long-term microglia reactivity and proper striatal circuit development.","Huntington's disease (HD) is associated with dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, including brain microvasscular endothelial cells (BMECs). We report changes in gene expression of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cell-like cells (iBMECs) derived from an isogenic pair of iPSCs with either 180 (HD-corrected) or 18 (HD180) CAG repeats in the HTT gene.","HD and control patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells were used to generate medium spiny neuron-like cells. four control in duplicate and  three HD samples in duplicate with CAG repeat length in juvenile onset range  were differentiated as biological growth replicates (separate differentiations) into medium spiny neuron-like cells. Cells were treated with LNPs with siRNA for knockdown of PIAS1 or a luciferase control. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit and QIAshredders for cell lysis.  For mouse data WT and HET GFP+ micro-dissected flash frozen brain regions (striatum) were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA were collected and purified using RNEasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Mice were treated with AAV2/1 expressing either a miRNA against Pias1 (miPias1.3), a control scrambled miRNA (miSafe). 1 µg of RNA with RIN values &gt;8 were used for library preparation using the strand specific Illumina TruSeq mRNA protocol.

HD changes at a molecular level may begin as early as in cells that are non-lineage committed such as stem cells or HD patients induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offering opportunity to enhance the understanding of the HD pathogenesis. In addition, juvenile HD non-linage committed cells were previously not directly investigated in detail by RNA-seq. Methods: Strand-specific RNA-seq of the whole transcriptome was performed using 3 clonal lines from each of 2 HD patients  (6 HD iPSC lines) with 71 or 109 CAG repeats in exon 1 of the HTT gene, and 2 healthy individuals, with 17/18 (2 clonal iPSC lines) and 21 CAG repeats (one iPSC line), to comprehensively identify mRNAs related to HD. A DESeq2 pipeline for transcripts of HD was developed to identify significantly dysregulated mRNAs. During the RNA-seq data analysis, we compared 6 HD iPSC lines vs control lines and also compared separately each set of 3 HD lines from one patient vs 3 control lines. As a result of such an approach, we generated statistical values for three comparison groups, HD vs WT, HD71Q vs WT and HD109Q vs WT Methods: 9 pM-indexed libraries were sequenced with the use of Illumina HiSeq2000, rapid run with paired-end 75 bp reads. On average, 65 mln reads were collected per library Results: We identified 107 (6 HD lines), 198 (3 HD71Q lines) and 217 (3 HD109Q lines) significantly dysregulated mRNAs in each comparison group. Conclusion: The analyses showed that many of dysregulated transcripts in HD109Q iPSC lines are involved in DNA damage response and apoptosis, such as CCND1, CDKN1A, TP53, BAX, TNFRSF10B, TNFRSF10C, TNFRSF10D, DDB2, PLCB1, PRKCQ, HSH2D, ZMAT3, PLK2, and RPS27L. Most of them were identified as downregulated and their proteins are direct interactors with TP53. HTT probably alters the level of several TP53 interactors influencing apoptosis.This may lead to accumulation of an excessive number of progenitor cells and potential disruption of cell differentiation and production of mature neurons. In addition, HTT effects on cell polarization also demonstrated in the analysis may result in a generation of incorrect progenitors.","Transcriptional dysregulation in Huntington’s disease (HD) is an early event that affects the expression of genes involved in survival and neuronal functions throughout the progression of the pathology. In the last years, extensive research has focused on epigenetic and chromatin-modifying factors as a causative explanation for such dysregulation, offering attractive targets for pharmacological therapies. In this work we examined the gene expression profiles in cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum of juvenile R6/1 and N171-82Q mice, two models of fast progressive HD, to retrieve the early transcriptional signatures associated with this pathology.These profiles showed significant coincidences with the transcriptional changes in the conditional knockout for the lysine acetyltransferase CBP in postmitotic forebrain neurons.","Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are a group of about 50 metabolic disorders, sharing the inability to degrade specific endolysosomal substrates.

Reports vary regarding the stability in these transcriptional patterns in the presence of external stressors.  Using Plasmodium yoelii 17X parasites replicating in vivo, we have examined differential gene expression in parasites isolated from individual mice, from independent infections, during ascending and peak parasitemia and in the presence and absence of host antibody responses.  Across experimental conditions, transcription was surprisingly stable.  Differential gene expression was greatest when comparing differences due to parasite load and/or host cell availability; however, even these changes were modest.  Of genes that were differentially expressed, many are of unknown function.  There was little to no differential expression of members of the yir and pyst-a multigene families, although a relatively large number of these were expressed during blood-stage infection regardless of experimental condition. Taken together, these results indicate that 1) P. yoelii gene expression remains stable in the presence of a changing host environment and 2) concurrent expression of a large number of the yir and pyst-a genes may function to divert host immune responses away from invariant protective antigens.","Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html  June 03, 2009: annotation table updated with netaffx build 28 June 07, 2012: annotation table updated with netaffx build 32 June 23, 2016: annotation table updated with netaffx build 35 Protocol: see manufacturer's web site  All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 are included on the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.

","Since its first description in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been the most common type of dementia. Initially thought to be caused by age-associated accumulation of plaques, in recent years, research has increasingly associated AD with lysosomal storage and metabolic disorders, and the explanation of its pathogenesis has shifted from amyloid and tau accumulation to oxidative stress and impaired lipid and glucose metabolism aggravated by hypoxic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms linking those cellular processes and conditions to disease progression have yet to be defined. Here, we applied a disease similarity approach to identify unknown molecular targets of AD by using transcriptomic data from congenital diseases known to increase AD risk, namely Down Syndrome, Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC), and Mucopolysaccharidoses I. We uncovered common pathways, hub genes, and miRNAs across in vitro and in vivo models of these diseases as potential molecular targets for neuroprotection and amelioration of AD pathology, many of which have never been associated with AD. We then investigated common molecular alterations in brain samples from an NPC disease mouse model by juxtaposing them with brain samples of both human and mouse models of AD. Detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses revealed the NPCmut mouse as a novel, short-lived in vivo model of AD characterized by accelerated brain aging, concluding that the NPCmut mouse model can serve as a potential short-lived in vivo model for AD research and for understanding molecular factors affecting brain aging. This research represents the first comprehensive approach to congenital disease association with neurodegeneration and a new perspective on AD research while highlighting shortcomings and lack of correlation in diverse in vitro models. Considering the lack of an AD mouse model that recapitulates the physiological hallmarks of brain aging, the characterization of a short-lived NPC mouse model will further accelerate the research in these fields and offer a unique model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD from a perspective of accelerated brain aging.","Nonsense mutations, responsible for ~11% of genetic diseases, create premature stop codons (PTCs) and lead to truncated and often non-functional proteins. Recently, programmable RNA pseudouridylation has emerged as a new type of RNA base editor to suppress PTCs. However, current methods suffer from low efficiency and limited precision. Here, we develop RESTART v3, an updated version of RESTART, which utilizes near-cognate tRNAs to improve the readthrough efficiency of pseudouridine-modified PTCs. We show an average of ~5-fold higher editing efficiency than RESTART v2 in cultured cells, currently the most active RNA pseudouridylation tool to mediate PTC readthrough. Moreover, RESTART v3 achieves functional PTC readthrough in disease cell models of cystic fibrosis and Hurler syndrome. Furthermore, RESTART v3 enables accurate incorporation of the original amino acid for nearly half of the PTC sites, considering the naturally occurring frequencies of sense to nonsense codons. In line with the benign off-target effect of RESTART, RESTART v3 does not change the coding information nor the expression level of transcripts with off-target editing; except for the specifically overexpressed tRNA molecule, it does not alter the expression level of endogenous tRNA pool. Overall, RESTART v3 represents an enhanced RNA base editor with increased efficiency and accuracy.","Nonsense mutations, responsible for ~11% of genetic diseases, create premature stop codons (PTCs) and lead to truncated and often non-functional proteins.

Furthermore, RESTART v3 enables accurate incorporation of the original amino acid for nearly half of the PTC sites, considering the naturally occurring frequencies of sense to nonsense codons. In line with the benign off-target effect of RESTART, RESTART v3 does not change the coding information nor the expression level of transcripts with off-target editing; except for the specifically overexpressed tRNA molecule, it does not alter the expression level of endogenous tRNA pool. Overall, RESTART v3 represents an enhanced RNA base editor with increased efficiency and accuracy.","Nonsense mutations, responsible for ~11% of genetic diseases, create premature stop codons (PTCs) and lead to truncated and often non-functional proteins. Recently, programmable RNA pseudouridylation has emerged as a new type of RNA base editor to suppress PTCs. However, current methods suffer from low efficiency and limited precision. Here, we develop RESTART v3, an updated version of RESTART, which utilizes near-cognate tRNAs to improve the readthrough efficiency of pseudouridine-modified PTCs.

The study was designed to estimate genistein, kaempferoland their mixture impact on global gene expression, with special focus on key processes in MPS pathogenesis. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying flavonoid treatment and identified distinct classes of regulated genes during this process.","In this study, we utilized a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) carrying a homozygous nonsense mutation in the Idua gene (Idua-W401X, TGG→TAG) to develop rAAV-delivered sup-tRNA therapeutics that can overcome a pathogenic UAG premature termination codon (PTC).","In this study, we utilized a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) carrying a homozygous nonsense mutation in the Idua gene (Idua-W401X, TGG→TAG) to develop rAAV-delivered sup-tRNA therapeutics that can overcome a pathogenic UAG premature termination codon (PTC).","In this study, we utilized a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) carrying a homozygous nonsense mutation in the Idua gene (Idua-W401X, TGG→TAG) to develop rAAV-delivered sup-tRNA therapeutics that can overcome a pathogenic UAG premature termination codon (PTC).","In this study, we utilized a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) carrying a homozygous nonsense mutation in the Idua gene (Idua-W401X, TGG→TAG) to develop rAAV-delivered sup-tRNA therapeutics that can overcome a pathogenic UAG premature termination codon (PTC).","In this study, we utilized a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) carrying a homozygous nonsense mutation in the Idua gene (Idua-W401X, TGG→TAG) to develop rAAV-delivered sup-tRNA therapeutics that can overcome a pathogenic UAG premature termination codon (PTC).","Association between the microbiome, IBD and liver diseases are known, yet cause and effect  remain elusive. By connecting human microphysiological systems of the gut, liver and circulating  Treg/Th17 cells, we modeled progression of ulcerative colitis (UC) ex vivo. We show that  microbiome-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) may either improve or worsen disease  severity, depending on the activation state of CD4 T cells. Employing a multiomic approach, we  found SCFA reduced innate activation of the UC gut and increased hepatic metabolism. However,  during acute T cell-mediated inflammation, SCFA exacerbate CD4 T cell effector function leading  to gut barrier disruption and liver damage. These paradoxical findings underscore the emerging  utility of human physiomimetic technology in combination with systems immunology to study  causality and temporal facets of gut-liver axis related diseases where animal models might leave  ambiguity.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are important delivery platforms for therapeutic genome editing but are severely constrained by cargo limits, especially for large effectors like Cas9s. Simultaneous delivery of multiple vectors can limit dose and efficacy and increase safety risks. The use of compact effectors has enabled single-AAV delivery of Cas9s with 1-3 guides for edits that use end-joining repair pathways, but many precise edits that correct disease-causing mutations in vivo require homology-directed repair (HDR) templates. Here, we describe  single-vector, ~4.8-kb AAV platforms that express Nme2Cas9 and either two sgRNAs to produce segmental deletions, or a single sgRNA with an HDR template. We also examine the utility of Nme2Cas9 target sites in the vector for self-inactivation. We demonstrate that these platforms can effectively treat two disease models [type I hereditary tyrosinemia (HT-I) and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I)] in mice. These results will enable single-vector AAVs to achieve diverse therapeutic genome editing outcomes.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is caused by genetic defects in alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), a lysosomal enzyme involved in the breakdown and recycling of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Although an enzyme replacement therapy is available, the efficacy for the treatment of neuropathic symptoms is limited. To facilitate drug discovery and model disease pathophysiology, we have generated neural stem cells (NSCs) from MPS I patient-derived iPSCs. NSCs exhibited characteristic disease phenotypes with deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and enlargement of lysosomes, correlating with the severity of clinical symptoms. Transcriptome profiling of NSCs revealed differential expression of 429 genes that changed more extensively in the more severe Hurler syndrome subgroup compared to the Hurler-Scheie (median severe) and Scheie (less severe) subgroups. Clustering and pathway analyses demonstrated high concordance of the severity of neurological defects with marked dysregulation of GAG biosynthesis and degradation, lysosomal function and extracellular matrix. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis identified a dramatic upregulation of autophagy pathway, especially in the Hurler syndrome. Thus, GAG accumulation in the patient cells disrupts lysosomal homeostasis affecting multiple related cellular pathways which compensates for IDUA deficiency. These dysregulated process likely lead to enhanced autophagy and more severe disease states. Our studies provide useful tools for clinical biomarker development and potential targets for drug development.","Comparisons of canine arterial gene expression between control and untreated MPS animals were conducted with a canine-specific microarray covering 43,803 probes (Agilent G2519F 4x44k, Santa Clara, CA), for a total of four comparison groups: MPS ascending aorta vs. control ascending aorta, MPS descending aorta vs. control descending aorta, MPS carotid artery vs. control carotid artery, and finally pooled MPS artery (ascending aorta, descending aorta, carotid artery) vs. pooled control artery. Each comparison used four pairs of MPS vs corresponding age- and gender- matched animals to produce four biologic replicates.","Establishment of a transcriptomic profile of human cells treated with genistein with particular emphasis on signature of genes coding for enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis stands for the present study. The hypothesis tested was that indomethacin and nimesulide influence expression of some genes among which are those coding for enzymes required for synthesis of different GAGs being pathologically accumulated in mucopolysaccharidoses. Results provide important information concerning the extent of action of indomethacin and nimesulide at the molecular level in terms of modulation of gene expression by these substances.","Establishment of a transcriptomic profile of human cells treated with genistein with particular emphasis on signature of genes coding for enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis stands for the present study.

The excitability of VTA DA neurons controls the release of DA in the projection fiber terminals thus controls the function of VTA DA neurons. After many years hard work, we begin to understand how the excitability of VTA DA neurons are regulated, but these achievements are far from satisfactory. Furthermore, with recent progress and realization that property of VTA DA neurons, against the classical view that VTA DA neurons are homogeneous population, are distinctly different, thus the accumulated limited knowledge on the mechanism of excitability modulation of VTA DA neurons is especially short of expectation. The most outstanding indications of the heterogeneity of VTA DA neurons are represented by the distinctly different electrophysiological properties among VTA DA neurons projecting to different brain regions. However the underlying mechanism is not clear. In this application we plan to investigate the underlying mechanism determining the distinct excitability of VTA DA neurons projecting to the cortical and the limbic regions of the brain by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The main focus of the study will be on the intrinsic ion channels and the related modulation mechanism of VTA DA neuron excitability. On the basis of this we will further study the mechanism which underlie alteration of excitability of VTA DA neurons in condition of depression state, and still further the related depression behaviour.","tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma is one kind of non-small-cell lung cancer with limit treatment options. We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the molecular characteristic of tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma, aiming to recognized this disease deeply and provide potential treatment plan in the future.","Traditional toxicity testing has been unable to keep pace with the introduction of new chemicals into commerce. Consequently, there are limited or no toxicity data upon which to base a risk assessment for many chemicals to which fish and wildlife may be exposed. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emblematic of this issue in that most the ecological hazards of most PFAS remain uncharacterized. The present study employed a high throughput assay to identify the concentration at which 20 PFAS, with diverse properties, elicited a concerted gene expression response in larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas, 5-6 days post-fertilization) exposed for 24 h. Based on a reduced transcriptome approach that measured whole body expression of 1832 genes, the median transcriptomic point of departure (tPOD) for the 20 PFAS tested was 10 µM. Longer chain carboxylic acids (12-13 C-F) and an eight C-F di-alcohol, N-alkyl sulfonamide, and telomer sulfonic acid were among the most potent PFAS, eliciting gene expression responses at concentrations below 1 µM. With a few exceptions, larval fathead minnow tPODs were concordant with those based on whole transcriptome response in human cell lines. However, larval fathead minnow tPODs were often greater than those for Daphnia magna exposed to the same PFAS. The tPODs overlapped concentrations at which other sub-lethal effects have been reported in fish (available for 10 PFAS; including a range of species, life stages, and study designs). Nonetheless, fathead minnow tPODs were all orders of magnitude higher than aqueous PFAS concentrations detected in tributaries of the North American Great Lakes suggesting a substantial margin of safety in those systems, even for PFAS with significant potential for bioaccumulation. Overall, results broadly support the use of a fathead minnow larval transcriptomics assay to derive screening level potency estimates for use in ecological risk-based prioritization.

Examining the effects of heat stress on the molecular mechanism of bovine oocytes can help to better understand their alterations on a transcriptional level and to plan and mitigate those effects. We aimed to study the response of oocytes to seasonal thermal stress.  Materials and Methods: Multiparous angus dry beef cows (n = 11) were kept together during the study and subjected to synchronisation and stimulation of follicular growth using a 5-day CIDR and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) protocol. Ovum pick-up (OPU) was conducted on all animals in the winter (January) and summer (August). Cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were isolated from the follicular fluid aspirated during the OPU procedure. Denuded oocytes were further isolated from the COCs, snap frozen, and stored at −80 °C until further use for library sequencing, RNA sequencing, bioinformatics and gene enrichment analysis. Additionally, rectal temperatures were recorded on the day of each OPU. Environmental data were collected daily three weeks before the day of each OPU using the Florida Automated Weather Network. Statistical analysis for average rectal temperature included overall mean (average rectal temperature), treatment effects (season), and the residual. Treatment effect was considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. RNA was extracted from five biological replicates/pools of oocytes (each containing n = 2) followed by library preparation and sequencing (NovaSeq; Illumina).  Results: As expected, environmental conditions were contrasting [average air temperature (11.5 °C vs 27.5 °C), average max air temperature (16.9 °C vs 33.7 °C), relative humidity (83.5% vs 82.3%), and temperature-humidity index (53.39 vs 79.16) for winter and summer, respectively]. Average rectal temperature was greater (P = 0.03) in summer (39.2 ± 0.2 °C) than in the winter (38.8 ± 0.2 °C). Data analysis revealed an up-regulation of 446 transcripts and a down-regulation of 940 transcripts in oocytes collected during summer compared to winter (Fold Change ≥ 2; FDR P-value ≤ 0.05). Upregulated transcripts are involved in protein digestion and absorption, ATP-binding cassette transporter, oocyte meiosis, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathways. Conversely, down-regulated transcripts are involved in pathways related to extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt signaling.  Conclusions: In conclusion, exposure of cows to thermal stress can significantly alter the transcriptome of oocytes, which may negatively impact subsequent developmental competence.","It is postulated that below a transcriptomic-based point of departure, adverse effects are unlikely to occur, thereby providing a chemical concentration to use in screening level hazard assessment.  The present study extends previous work describing a high throughput fathead minnow assay that can provide full transcriptomic data after exposure to a test chemical.  One day post-hatch fathead minnows were exposed to ten concentrations of three representatives of four chemical modes of action: organophosphates, ecdysone receptor agonists, plant photosystem II inhibitors, and estrogen receptor agonists for 24 hours.  Concentration response modeling was performed on whole body gene expression data from each exposure, using measured chemical concentrations when available.  Transcriptomic points of departure in larval fathead minnow were lower than apical effect concentrations across fish species but not always lower than toxic effect concentrations in other aquatic taxa like crustaceans and insects.  The point of departure was highly dependent on measured chemical concentration which were often lower than the nominal concentration.  Differentially expressed genes between chemicals within modes of action were compared and often showed statistically significant overlap.  In addition, reproducibility between identical exposures using a positive control chemical (CuSO4) and variability associated with the transcriptomic point of departure using in-silico sampling were considered.  Results extend a transcriptomic-compatible fathead minnow high throughput assay for possible use in ecological hazard screening.","Gastrulation is the highly coordinated process by which the early embryo breaks symmetry, establishes germ layers and a body plan, and sets the stage for organogenesis. As early mammalian development is challenging to study in vivo, stem cell-derived models have emerged as powerful surrogates, e.g. human and mouse gastruloids. However, although single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and high-resolution imaging have been extensively applied to characterize such in vitro embryo models, a paucity of measurements of protein dynamics and regulation leaves a major gap in our understanding. Here we sought to address this by applying quantitative proteomics to human and mouse gastruloids at four key stages of their differentiation (naïve ESCs, primed ESCs, early gastruloids, late gastruloids). To the resulting data, we perform network analysis to map the dynamics of expression of macromolecular protein complexes and biochemical pathways, including identifying cooperative proteins that associate with them. With matched RNA-seq and phosphosite data from these same stages, we investigate pathway-, stage- and species-specific aspects of translational and post-translational regulation, e.g. finding peri-gastrulation stages of human vs. mice to be discordant with respect to the mitochondrial transcriptome vs. proteome, and nominating novel kinase-substrate relationships based on phosphosite dynamics. Finally, we leverage correlated dynamics to identify conserved protein networks centered around congenital disease genes. Altogether, our study showcases the potential of intersecting proteomics and in vitro embryo models to advance our understanding of early mammalian development in ways that may not be possible through transcriptomics alone.","The major aim of our study was to uncover tumor-specific transcriptional and epigenetic changes in peripheral blood monocytes in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Another key point was to elucidate how chemotherapy can reprogram monocytes and how that relates to changes in other immune subpopulations in the blood. To this end, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with HGSOC who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment (NACT) and in treatment-naïve patients. Monocyte cluster was significantly affected by tumor-derived factors as well as by chemotherapeutic impact. Bioinformatical analysis revealed three distinct monocyte subpopulations within PBMCs based on feature gene expression – CD14.Mn.S100A8.9hi, CD14.Mn.MHC2hi and CD16.Mn subsets. The intriguing result was that NACT induced antigen presentation in monocytes by the transcriptional upregulation of MHC class II molecules, but not by epigenetic changes. Increased MHC class II gene expression was a feature observed across all three monocyte subpopulations after chemotherapy. Our data also demonstrated that chemotherapy inhibited interferon-dependent signaling pathways, but activated some TGFb-related genes. Our results can enable personalized decision regarding the necessity to systemically re-educate immune cells to prime ovarian cancer to respond to anti-cancer therapy or to improve personalized prescription of existing immunotherapy in either combination with chemotherapy or a monotherapy regimen.","The major aim of our study was to uncover tumor-specific transcriptional and epigenetic changes in peripheral blood monocytes in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).

Within the clade of deuterostomes, hemichordates and echinoderms (together called Ambulacraria) are sister groups of chordates; comparative studies among the three are insightful for understanding deuterostome evolution. Indirect-developing hemichordates, such as Ptychodera flava, develop into planktonic larvae, which are morphologically similar to echinoderm larvae, before metamorphosing into the adult body plan that retains an anteroposterior polarity homologous to that of chordates. Therefore, deciphering developmental programmes of indirect-developing hemichordates may provide a key for understanding the evolution of deuterostomes and chordate origins. Here, we characterise transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility across multiple developmental stages of P. flava and uncover biphasic developmental programmes controlled by different sets of transcription factors and their corresponding cis-regulatory elements. Transcriptome age and network analyses reveal that the gastrula transcriptome is relatively ancient and highly connected. By comparing developmental transcriptomes of hemichordate, sea urchin and amphioxus, a high conservation of gene expression during gastrulation is identified and extended to neurula stages of amphioxus, in addition to the highly similar larval transcriptomes among the three species. Moreover, P. flava possesses conserved interactions of transcription factors required for the development of echinoderm endomesoderm and chordate axial mesoderm. These results suggest a deuterostome phylotypic stage during gastrulation (corresponding to amphioxus gastrulation and neurulation) controlled by gene regulatory networks with conserved cis-regulatory interactions, and support the hypothesis that the deuterostome ancestor is an indirect-developer.","Evolutionary history of deuterostomes has remained unsolved and is intimately related to how chordates originated.

When the cell cycle is activated, HSCs gradually lose the hematopoietic reconstruction ability. It indicates that the maintenance of the quiescent state of HSPCs has very important physiological significance. However, the maintenance and regulation mechanism of the quiescent state of HSCs has not yet been clarified. We found that TSC22D3 was highly enriched in quiescent state HSCs but downregulated in culture with the activation of the cell cycle. We further confirmed that stabilizing TSC22D3 expression in HSCs could promote the maintenance of the quiescent state and provide balanced multilineage reconstitution in primary mouse recipients.We found that overexpression of TSC22D3 can promote the maintenance of the resting state of HSCs and the ability of hematopoietic reconstitution by inhibiting the expression of cell cycle-related kinases. Also we confirmed that TSC22D3 can promote the accumulation of p53 protein in cells and up-regulate the expression of p21, p27 and other proteins by qPCR and western blot. Therefore, we speculate that TSC22D3 can promote the resting state of HSCs by regulating the stability of p53. It remains elusive that how TSC22D3 plays a role in the regulation of the maintenance of HSCs in vitro, therefore, further investigations are required to depict its underlying mechanism. On this basis, We firstly plan to analyze the potential downstream targets of TSC22D3 in the maintenance of HSCs in vitro through RNA-seq based transcriptome comparison; then, we will verify the predicted targets of TSC22D3 through Co-IP, gene overexpression, gene knockdown, and signaling pathway activation/inhibition. Our project could contribute to an in-depth understanding of the quiescent maintenance mechanisms of HSPCs in vitro and provide ideas for the treatment of leukemia and other malignant hematological diseases.","Human gastrulation is a dynamic, complex, and poorly understood process. Starting from a seemingly homogenous population, cell and tissue organization during this process establishes the 3D organismal body plan. However, due to technical and ethical limitations, mechanisms of human gastrulation are largely unexplored. For example, it is generally unclear whether a spatially ordered, external cue is necessary for patterning, or whether the epiblast harbors the innate ability to differentiate and self-organize in the absence of asymmetric cues. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) fortunately offer the potential to model gastrulation, most notably through generation of 3D “gastruloids”. Here we use optogenetic control of Wnt signaling to establish a 3D hPSC gastruloid model and demonstrate the spatially-ordered emergence of the three germ layer lineages in the absence of exogenous asymmetrical cues.","The blueprint of the mammalian body plan is laid out during gastrulation, when a trilaminar embryo is formed. This process entails a burst of embryonic cell proliferation, the ingression of pluripotent epithelial cells at the primitive streak, and their priming towards primitive streak fates. How these different events are coordinated remains unknown. Here, we developed a 3D culture of self-renewing pluripotent and epithelial cells that recapitulates the transcriptional and architectural features of the gastrulating mouse embryo. Using this system in combination with microfabrication and in vivo experiments, we found that proliferation triggers basal extrusion in cells that express high levels of the apical polarity protein aPKC. Upon extrusion, cells are more sensitive to Bmp, Wnt, and Nodal signaling, and upregulate the expression of primitive streak markers. This mechanistic coupling between cell position and gene expression ensures that the right cell types become specified at the right place during embryonic development.","In the past, animal experiments with rats, by depleting various amino acids in the diet, have shown that a deficiency of methionine inhibits tumor growth at the individual level and that methionine is important in the development and progression of cancer. This methionine is one of the essential amino acids and is the initiation codon that initiates protein translation from mRNA. Methionine is known to be converted to SAM, which is required for nucleic acid synthesis in cancer. Tumors are underdeveloped in an environment deficient in methionine, which is known as the \"Hoffman effect\". In fact, past reports have shown that in the absence of methionine, tumor growth is suppressed, and methionine has recently been shown to be essential in cancer stem cells or \"tumor initiating cells\". In addition, the focus on methionine in cancer is said to influence tumor-cell metabolism, histone patterns, and T cell immunity in the cancer microenvironment. In cancer immunity, not only methionine but also its upstream pathways are said to be involved. Tryptophan/niacin, which is located upstream of the methionine cycle, is metabolized to form nicotinamide, and MNAM is formed from the SAM and nicotinamide via nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). NNMT and MNAM have been reported to participate in the mechanism of inhibition of the apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1-p38 MAPK pathway, resulting in increased colon cancer cell resistance to 5-FU. NNMTs promote nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide depletion and epigenetic reprogramming, which have been implicated in the development of metabolic plasticity, circumvention of the major tumor suppressive process of cellular senescence, acquisition of stem cell properties, and resistance to therapy and poor clinical outcomes. Also, MNAM synthesized in this methionine cycle is said to suppress T cells and promote cancer. Hence, we implanted the colon cancer cell line HT-29 cultured in normal medium with all nutrients into NOD SCID mice and kept them for 2 weeks on a diet without the aforementioned methionine/tryptophan/niacin. Afterwards, tumors were removed and RNA-sequencing was performed, and a marked increase in the expression of RN7SL1, a non-coding RNA, was observed.","In the past, animal experiments with rats, by depleting various amino acids in the diet, have shown that a deficiency of methionine inhibits tumor growth at the individual level and that methionine is important in the development and progression of cancer.

NNMTs promote nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide depletion and epigenetic reprogramming, which have been implicated in the development of metabolic plasticity, circumvention of the major tumor suppressive process of cellular senescence, acquisition of stem cell properties, and resistance to therapy and poor clinical outcomes. Also, MNAM synthesized in this methionine cycle is said to suppress T cells and promote cancer. Hence, we implanted the colon cancer cell line HT-29 cultured in normal medium with all nutrients into NOD SCID mice and kept them for 2 weeks on a diet without the aforementioned methionine/tryptophan/niacin. Afterwards, tumors were removed and RNA-sequencing was performed, and a marked increase in the expression of RN7SL1, a non-coding RNA, was observed.","Malignancies can become reliant on glutamine as an alternative energy source and as a facilitator of aberrant DNA methylation, thus implicating glutaminase (GLS) as a potential therapeutic target. We demonstrate preclinical synergy of telaglenastat (CB-839), a selective GLS inhibitor, when combined with azacytidine (AZA), in vitro and in vivo, followed by a phase Ib/II study of the combination in patients with advanced MDS. Treatment with telaglenastat/AZA led to an ORR of 70% with CR/mCRs in 53% patients and a median overall survival of 11.6 months. scRNAseq and flow cytometry demonstrated a myeloid differentiation program at the stem cell level in clinical responders. Expression of non-canonical glutamine transporter, SLC38A1, was found to be overexpressed in MDS stem cells; was associated with clinical responses to telaglenastat/AZA and predictive of worse prognosis in a large MDS cohort. These data demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a combined metabolic and epigenetic approach in MDS.","This dataset includes RNA-seq data from ileal and colonic biopsies at time of diagnosis for treatment-naive, uncomplicated Crohn's disease (CD) patients and matched controls. This is includes 56 CD patients each for ileal and colonic tissue and for controls, 46 colonic samples and 45 ileal samples. Clinical characteristics such as development of complications, disease remission, or progression to surgery were recorded with a mean follow-up of 6 years.","In the past, animal experiments with rats, by depleting various amino acids in the diet, have shown that a deficiency of methionine inhibits tumor growth at the individual level and that methionine is important in the development and progression of cancer. This methionine is one of the essential amino acids and is the initiation codon that initiates protein translation from mRNA. Methionine is known to be converted to SAM, which is required for nucleic acid synthesis in cancer. Tumors are underdeveloped in an environment deficient in methionine, which is known as the \"Hoffman effect\". In fact, past reports have shown that in the absence of methionine, tumor growth is suppressed, and methionine has recently been shown to be essential in cancer stem cells or \"tumor initiating cells\". In addition, the focus on methionine in cancer is said to influence tumor-cell metabolism, histone patterns, and T cell immunity in the cancer microenvironment.  In cancer immunity, not only methionine but also its upstream pathways are said to be involved. Tryptophan/niacin, which is located upstream of the methionine cycle, is metabolized to form nicotinamide, and MNAM is formed from the SAM and nicotinamide via nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). NNMT and MNAM have been reported to participate in the mechanism of inhibition of the apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1-p38 MAPK pathway, resulting in increased colon cancer cell resistance to 5-FU.

Copy number analysis of SNP arrays was performed on one INAD patient sample.","Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6) are the major long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) of the central nervous system. We examined the alterations in transcriptional profiles in neonate baboon cerebral cortex brain tissue using high-density Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays (\"U133 plus 2.0\"). Twelve neonates were divided into 3 groups: Control (C, no DHA-ARA); 1× LCPUFA (L, 0.33%DHA-0.67%ARA); 3× LCPUFA (L3, 1.00%DHA-0.67%ARA). Significance analysis (P &lt; 0.05) of a total of &gt;54,000 probe sets (ps) identified changes in expression levels of 1108 ps, representing 2.05% of the total ps on the oligoarray, with most ps showing &lt;2-fold change. Comparing L and C, 534 ps were upregulated with supplementation, and 574 ps were downregulated.  For the L3/C comparisons, 666 ps were upregulated and 442 ps were downregulated.  Characterization of differentially regulated genes by gene ontology assign them to diverse biological functions, notably lipid metabolism, ion channel and transport, G-protein and signal transduction, development, visual perception, membrane function, apoptosis, cytoskeleton, peptidases, cell cycle, stress response, kinases and phosphatases, transcription regulation, receptors, and ubiquitin, with about 400 transcripts having no defined function.  Of differentially expressed genes involved in lipid metabolism, PLA2G6, a phospholipase recently associated with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, was downregulated in both LCPUFA groups.  ELOVL5, a PUFA elongase, was the only enzyme in the LCPUFA biosynthetic pathway that was differentially expressed.  Mitochondrial fatty acid carrier, CPT2, was among several genes associated with mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to be downregulated, while the mitochondrial proton carrier, UCP2, was upregulated.  PUFA-regulated receptor, Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) was repressed in both groups, while HNF4A, a PUFA regulated factor, was downregulated in L3/C.  Genes involved in neural development, TIMM8A, NRG1, SEMA3D and NUMB, were upregulated while HES1 and SIM1 showed decreased expression. LUM, EML2, TIMP3 and TTC8 which have roles in visual perception were upregulated and TIA1, a silencer of COX2 gene translation is upregulated in L3/C. Ingenuity network analysis identified a top network associated with nervous system development and function with EGFR as the outstanding interaction partner. In this network EGFR interacts with genes involved in neural or visual perception, TIMP3, NRG1, ADAM17, EDG7 and FGF7. Quantitative real time-PCR analysis on selected genes confirmed the array results. The L and L3 groups have DHA and ARA content within the ranges observed in human and baboon breastmilk, and thus these data indicate that LCPUFA concentrations within the normal range of human breastmilk induce global changes in gene expression across numerous functions including transcripts involved in neural development, visual perception, etc. Keywords: dietary dose response","Analysis of precentral gyri from neonates fed for 12 weeks with either a formula containing both 0.33% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 0.67% arachidonic acid (ARA) or one with 1.0% DHA and 0.67% ARA. DHA and AHA are the major long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of the central nervous system.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","In endometrioid carcinoma (EC), grade 1 (G1) EC is generally associated with a good prognosis. However, in a minority of G1, we often find a more aggressive histological pattern: MELF (microcystic, elongated, and fragmented) pattern. We previously revealed that EC with high expression of S100A4 and serum deprivation-response protein (SDPR) was related to MELF pattern invasion. However, the molecular feature of the invasive front area of MELF pattern has not been investigated. In the current study, we searched for genes preferentially expressed in the invasive front area of EC with MELF pattern by using laser microdissection and RNA sequencing, and revealed that Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is related to invasiveness of MELF pattern. We confirmed that NNMT expression was high in the invasive front area of MELF pattern in immunohistochemical analysis. Moreover, using endometrioid carcinoma cell lines, we showed that NNMT promotes migration, invasion, colony formation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and chemoresistance. We speculated that depletion of NNMT promotes histone methylation and leads to tumor suppression because NNMT consumes S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which is an essential methylation cofactor. We showed that NNMT-knockout cells the expression of H3K9me2 was enhanced. We speculate that methylation of H3K9 lead to repress the transcription of various oncogenic genes by performing RNA sequencing using NNMT-knockout cell lines. Our findings showed the possibility that NNMT inhibitors, which are expected to be used for the treatment of metabolic disorders, is effective for the treatment of an aggressive EC. This is the first report of the gene analysis focused on the morphological changes of MELF pattern invasion of EC.","In endometrioid carcinoma (EC), grade 1 (G1) EC is generally associated with a good prognosis.

Among these, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD) are the most widespread ones. However, little is known about the common aspects between these conditions and how these aspects can be linked to aging itself. With this work, we aim to identify a molecular fil rouge that could link aging and different dementias in order to possibly highlight strategic targets for novel therapeutical approaches. A whole transcriptome analysis and a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) have been carried out on brain samples from hippocampus (HI), temporal and parietal cortex (TC, PC), cingulate cortex (CG), and substantia nigra (SN) from the Abbiategrasso Brain Bank (ABB) of subjects with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD and LBD (6 per pathology) and 3 age-matched controls with no dementia (CTRLs). Clinical and neuropsychological profile were obtained through serial evaluations, made at the baseline and in the following years. According to the ABB protocol, the neuropathological diagnosis was based on a complete histological characterization, including all the main proteinopathies and vascular scoring. Transcriptomic results showed some major differences in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two pathologies and in particular that AD brains gene expression is more affected compared to LBD’s one (DEGsAD=3156; DEGsLBD=278). Furthermore, the GSEA showed that in AD it is possible to cluster the analysed regions by biological processes (HI and TC: DEGs primarily related to synaptic transmission; PC, CG and SN: DEGs primarily related to proper protein folding and inflammation) while in LBD there is only a strong and peculiar involvement of SN (DEGs primarily related to proper protein folding and inflammation) and PC (DEGs primarily related to myelination and glial system activation). AD and LBD are different forms of dementia characterized by a definite time and severity-related pattern. Therefore, it is possible to draw a molecular map of pathology spreading in the brain that could unveil unexplored roads and possible shortcuts leading to a better understanding of AD and LBD pathogenesis. This could help to discover novel biological targets in order to develop effective and well-timed therapeutical approaches.","Aggregated α-synuclein (α-SYN) proteins, encoded by the SNCA gene, are hallmarks of Lewy body disease (LBD), affecting multiple brain regions. However, the specific mechanisms underlying α-SYN pathology in cortical neurons, crucial for LBD-associated dementia, remain unclear. Here, we generated human cortical LBD models by differentiating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from SNCA triplication LBD patients into cerebral organoids and observed increased levels of pathological α-SYN in these organoids. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed prominent expression of the SNCA gene in excitatory neurons, which exhibited synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction, consistent with findings in the cortex of LBD human brains. Furthermore, screening 1280 FDA-approved drugs identified four candidates, which inhibited α-SYN seeding in RT-QuIC assay, reduced α-SYN aggregation and alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction in SNCA triplication iPSC models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the development of cortical LBD models and the discovery of potential drugs targeting α-SYN aggregation.","Aggregated α-synuclein (α-SYN) proteins, encoded by the SNCA gene, are hallmarks of Lewy body disease (LBD), affecting multiple brain regions.

THRα has in mammals two major splicing isoforms, THRα1 and THRα2. The better characterized isoform, THRα1, is a transcriptional stimulator of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth. The less well characterized isoform, THRα2, lacks the Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) and is thought to act as an inhibitor of THRα1 action. The ratio of THRα1 to THRα2 splicing isoforms is therefore critical for transcriptional regulation in different tissues and during development. However, the expression patterns of both isoforms have not been studied in healthy human tissues or in the developing brain. Given the lack of commercially available isoform-specific antibodies, we addressed this question by analyzing four bulk RNA-sequencing datasets and two scRNA-sequencing datasets to determine the RNA expression levels of human THRA1 and THRA2 transcripts in healthy adult tissues and in the developing brain. We demonstrate how 10X Chromium scRNA-seq datasets can be used to perform splicing-sensitive analyses of isoforms that differ at the 3'-end. In all datasets, we discovered a strong predominance of THRA2 transcripts at all stages of brain development and in central nervous system from healthy human adults.","Breast cancer is a leading cause of female mortality and despite advancements in personalized therapeutics, metastatic disease largely remains incurable due to drug resistance. The estrogen receptor (ER, ESR1) is expressed in two-thirds of all breast cancer, and under endocrine stress, somatic ESR1 mutations arise in ~30% of cases that result in endocrine resistance. We and others reported ESR1 fusions as a mechanism of ER mediated endocrine resistance. ER fusions, which retain the AF1 and DNA binding domains, harbor ESR1 exons 1-6 fused to an in-frame gene partner resulting in loss of the ER ligand binding domain (LBD). We demonstrate that in a no-special type (invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)- NST) and an invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) cell line, ER fusions exhibit robust hyperactivation of canonical ER signaling pathways independent of estradiol or anti-endocrine therapies. We employ cell line models stably overexpressing ER fusions with concurrent endogenous ER knockdown to minimize endogenous ER influence. Cell lines exhibited shared transcriptomic enrichment in pathways known to be drivers of metastatic disease, notably MYC signaling. Cells expressing the 3’ fusion partners SOX9 and YAP1 consistently demonstrated enhanced growth and cell survival. ILC cells expressing the DAB2 fusion led to enhanced growth, survival, and migration; phenotypes not appreciated in the IDC- NST DAB2 model. Herein, we report that cell line activity is subtype-, fusion-, and assay-specific suggesting that LBD loss, the fusion partner, and the cellular landscape all influence fusion activities. Therefore, it will be critical to assess fusion frequency, in the context of the tumor clinicopathology.","The microRNA390 targets the TAS3 transcript leading to the production of trans-acting small interference RNAs that subsequently post-transcriptionally repress the mRNAs encoding the Auxin Response Factors (ARF)2, ARF3, and ARF4. This module has been linked to the development of lateral organs in both aerial and underground tissues. Previously, we have shown that the miR390/TAS3/ARFs module mediates the control of lateral roots and symbiotic nodules in legumes. Here, we show that a member of the Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain (LBD) family of transcription factors, designated as MtLBD17/29a, is a target of the miR390/TAS3/ARFs module. Transcriptomic, RT-qPCR and promoter fusion analysis revealed that MtLBD17/29a is induced under symbiotic conditions, whereas no induction was observed in roots overexpressing miR390 or silenced in ARF2/3/4. ChIP-PCR experiments demonstrated that MtARF2 directly binds to an Auxin Response Element (ARE) present in the MtLBD17/29a promoter activating its expression. Knockdown of MtLBD17/29a reduced the length of primary and lateral roots and increasing the density of lateral roots, whereas overexpression of MtLBD17/29a produced the opposite phenotype. Interestingly, both knockdown and overexpression of MtLBD17/29a resulted in a significant reduction in the number of nodules and infection events, as well as impaired the induction of the symbiotic genes Nodulation Signaling Pathway (NSP) 1 and 2, reminiscent of the phenotype observed in ARF2/3/4 silenced roots. These results demonstrate that MtLBD17/29 is regulated by the miR390/TAS3/ARFs module and a direct target of ARF2, revealing a new lateral root regulatory hub recruited by legumes to act in the root nodule symbiotic program.","Breast cancer is a leading cause of female mortality and despite advancements in personalized therapeutics, metastatic disease largely remains incurable due to drug resistance.

For parents, we used the inbred strain MR-VPi that is highly resistant to multiple acaricides in different classes, and the inbred strain ROS-ITi that is comparatively susceptible to many acaricides. The eQTL mapping experiment was performed with F3 samples, and thousands of trans and cis eQTL were identified, including for genes in families known (or suspected) to be involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics (plant produced secondary compounds and acaricides). One trans eQTL hotspot was identified that strongly impacted the expression of many detoxification genes in different gene families. Follow up studies using derived near isogenic lines validated the trans eQTL hotspot, and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of tandemly duplicated genes encoding products with homology to the ligand binding domains of nuclear hormone receptor 96 genes impacted many of the same detoxification genes controlled by the hotspot.","To investigate the transcriptomic characteristics of CD11b+F4/80+ cells in the brain of JEV- infected WT and Vegfr-3ΔLBD/ΔLBD mice, we sorted the CD11b+F4/80+ cells from  the brain of  WT and Vegfr-3ΔLBD/ΔLBD mice post 5 days of JEV infection by FACS. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of 2 different cells.","Mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) associated with prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome may profoundly influence its structure, protein interaction network and binding to chromatin, resulting in altered transcription signatures and drug responses. Current structural information fails to explain the effect of pathological mutations on AR structure-function relationship. Here we have thoroughly studied the effects of selected mutations that span the complete dimer interface of AR ligand-binding domain (AR-LBD) using X-ray crystallography in combination with in vitro, in silico, and cell-based assays. We show that these variants alter AR-dependent transcription and responses to anti-androgens by inducing a previously undescribed allosteric switch in the AR-LBD that increases exposure of residue Arg761 and ultimately leads to its enhanced methylation. We also corroborate the relevance of residues Arg761 and Tyr764 for AR dimerization and function. Together, our results reveal allosteric coupling of AR dimerization and post-translational modifications as a disease mechanism with implications for precision medicine.","The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that controls metabolic and homeostatic processes essential for life. Although numerous crystal structures of the GR ligand-binding domain (GR-LBD) have been reported, the functional oligomeric state of the full-length receptor (FL-GR), which is essential for its transcriptional activity, remains disputed. Here we present five new crystal structures of agonist-bound GR-LBD, along with a thorough analysis of previous structural work. We identify four distinct homodimerization interfaces on the GR-LBD surface, which can associate into 20 topologically different homodimers. Biologically relevant homodimers were identified by studying a battery of GR point mutants including crosslinking assays in solution, quantitative fluorescence microscopy in living cells, and transcriptomic analyses. Our results highlight the relevance of non-canonical dimerization modes for GR, especially of contacts made by loop L1-3 residues such as Tyr545. Our work illustrates the unique flexibility of GR’s LBD and suggest many dimeric conformations can coexist within cells. In addition, we unveil pathophysiologically relevant quaternary assemblies of the receptor with important implications for glucocorticoid action and drug design.","The trans-luminal LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex plays a central role in nuclear mechanotransduction by coupling the nucleus with cytoskeleton. High spatial density and active dynamics of LINC complex have hindered its precise characterization for the understanding of underlying mechanisms how the linkages sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. In this study, we focus on SUN2, a core component of LINC complex interconnecting the nuclear lamina and actin cytoskeleton and apply single molecule super-resolution imaging to reveal how SUN2 responds to actomyosin contractility. Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we quantitated the distribution pattern and density of SUN2 on the basal nuclear membrane. We found that SUN2 undergoes bidirectional translocation between ER and nuclear membrane in response to actomyosin contractility, suggesting that dynamic constrained force on SUN2 is required for its proper distribution. Furthermore, single molecule imaging unveils interesting dynamics of SUN2 molecules that are regulated by both actomyosin contractility and laminA/C network, whereas SUN2 oligomeric states are not affected by actomyosin contractility. Lastly, the mechanical response of SUN2 to actomyosin contractility was found to regulate expression of mechano-sensitive genes located in lamina-associated domains (LADs) and perinuclear heterochromatin. Taken together, our results reveal how SUN2 responds to mechanical cues at the single-molecule level, providing new insights into the mechanism of nuclear mechanotransduction.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) are two different forms of  dementia but their pathology may involve the same cortical areas with overlapping cognitive  manifestation. Dementia cases within the same family share a common genetic background.  Nonetheless, the clinical phenotype may be different due to the different underlying molecular  processes that come-up apart from genetics, causing diverse neurodegeneration. Through  neuropathological, genetic and transcriptomic comparison of four different brain areas  (substantia nigra, hippocampus, parietal lobe and basal ganglia), we defined commonalities  and differences in the pathological processes of dementia in two kindred cases, a mother and a  son, who developed a classical AD and an aggressive form of AD/LBD respectively. Genetic  analysis did not reveal any pathogenic variants in the principal AD/LBD-causative genes.  RNA sequencing highlighted high transcriptional dysregulation within the substantia nigra in  LBD pathology, while AD underwent lower degree of transcriptional dysregulation, with the  parietal lobe being the most involved brain area. Conversely, hippocampus (the most  degenerated area) and basal ganglia (lacking specific lesions) expressed the lowest level of  dysregulation. Our data suggest that there is a link between the transcriptional dysregulation  and the amount of tissue damage accumulated across time, assessed through neuropathology.  Moreover, we highlight that the molecular bases of AD and LBD follow very different  pathways, which underlie their neuropathological signatures. Indeed, the transcriptome  profiling through RNA sequencing may be an important tool in flanking the  neuropathological analysis for a deeper understanding of AD and LBD pathogenesis.","The main avenue for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine remains the induction of protective antibodies. A rationale approach is to target antigen to specific receptors on dendritic cells (DC) via fused monoclonal antibodies (mAb). In mouse and non-human primate models, targeting of skin Langerhans cells (LC) with anti-Langerin mAbs fused with HIV-1 Gag antigen drives antigen-specific humoral responses. The development of these immunization strategies in humans requires a better understanding of early immune events driven by human LC. We therefore produced anti-Langerin mAbs fused with the HIV-1 gp140z Envelope (αLC.Env). First, we show that primary skin human LC and in vitro differentiated LC induce differentiation and expansion of naïve CD4+ T cells into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Second, when human LC are pre-treated with αLC.Env, differentiated Tfh cells significantly promote the production of specific IgG by B cells. Strikingly, HIV-Env-specific Ig are secreted by HIV-specific memory B cells. Consistently, we found that receptors and cytokines involved in Tfh differentiation and B cell functions are upregulated by LC during their maturation and after targeting Langerin. Finally, we show that subcutaneous immunisation of mice by αLC.Env induces germinal center (GC) reaction in draining lymph nodes with higher numbers of Tfh cells, Env-specific B cells, as well as specific IgG serum levels compared to mice immunised with the non-targeting Env antigen. Altogether, we provide evidence that human LC properly targeted may be licensed to efficiently induce Tfh cell and B cell responses in GC.","The goal of the study was to investigate if DNA methylation is associated with Lewy body pathology in human brain tissue. The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 850,000 CpGs in postmortem human frontal cortex samples from European donors in the Netherlands Brain Bank. Following quality checks, sample filtering and normalization, association between CpG methylation and Braak alpha-synuclein stage was assessed using linear models.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Activating estrogen receptor alpha (ER) mutations are present in primary endometrial and metastatic breast cancers, promoting estrogen-independent activation of the receptor. Functional characterizations in breast cancer have established unique molecular and phenotypic consequences of the receptor, yet the impact of ER mutations in endometrial cancer has not been fully explored. In this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to model the clinically prevalent ER-Y537S mutation and compared results to ER-D538G to discover allele-specific differences between ER mutations in endometrial cancer. We found that constitutive activity of mutant ER resulted in changes in the expression of thousands of genes, stemming from combined alterations to ER binding and chromatin accessibility. The unique gene expression programs resulted in ER mutant cells developing increased cancer associated phenotypes, including migration, invasion, anchorage independent growth, and growth in vivo. To uncover potential treatment strategies, we identified ER associated proteins via Rapid Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry of Endogenous Proteins (RIME) and interrogated two candidates, CDK9 and NCOA3. Inhibition of these regulatory protein resulted in decreased growth and migration, representing potential novel treatment strategies for ER mutant endometrial cancer. Taken together, this study provides insight into ER mutant activity in endometrial cancer and identifies potential therapies for women with ER mutant endometrial cancer.","Activating estrogen receptor alpha (ER) mutations are present in primary endometrial and metastatic breast cancers, promoting estrogen-independent activation of the receptor.

Here we functionally screened 15 ESR1 fusions and identified 10 that promoted estradiol-independent cell growth, motility, invasion, EMT and resistance to fulvestrant. RNA sequencing identified a gene expression pattern specific to functionally active ESR1 gene fusions that was subsequently reduced to a diagnostic 24-gene signature. This signature was further examined in 20 ERα+ patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and in 55 ERα+ MBC samples. The 24-gene signature successfully identified cases harboring ESR1 gene fusions and also accurately diagnosed the presence of activating ESR1 LBD point mutations. Therefore, the 24-gene signature represents an efficient approach to screening samples for the presence of diverse somaticESR1 mutations and translocations that drive endocrine treatment failure in MBC.","We recently identified a gene module of 87 genes co-expressed with MCL1 (MCL1-M), a critical regulator of plasma cell survival. MCL1-M captures both MM cell-intrinsically acting signals and the signals regulating the interaction between MM cells with bone marrow microenvironment. MM can be clustered into MCL1-M high and MCL1-M low subtypes. While the MCL1-M high MMs are enriched in a preplasmablast signature, the MCL1-M low MMs are enriched in B cell-specific genes. In multiple independent datasets, MCL1-M high MMs exhibited poorer prognosis compared to MCL1-M low MMs. Re-analysis of the phase III HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 showed that only MCL1-M MMs, but not MCL1-M low MMs, benefited from bortezomib-based treatment. To translate the MCL1-M clustering scheme into a platform for individual diagnosis, we refined the classifier genes and developed a support vector machine-based algorithm. Individual MMs with transcriptome assessed at the RNA-seq or U133 plus 2.0 array platform can be robustly assigned as the MCL1-M high or low subtype with high confidence. Analyses of the MM samples in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial and APEX trial reinforce that only MCL1-M high MMs benefit from bortezomib-based treatment with a hazard ratio of 0.58 (P = 0.010) and 0.47 (P = 0.009), respectively. Thus, MCL1-M based subtyping assigns MMs into prognostic and predictive molecular subtypes driven by subtype-specific pathogenic pathways.","We have completed the Human lncRNA microarray analysis of the 4 samples that you submitted. Total RNA from each sample was quantified using the Nanodrop 1000 and the RNA integrity was assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. About 5 μg total RNA of each sample was used for labeling and array hybridization as the following steps: 1) Reverse transcription with invitrogen Superscript ds-cDNA synthesis kit; 2) ds-cDNA labeling with Nimblegen one-color DNA labeling kit; 3) Array hybridization using the NimbleGen Hybridization System and followed by washing with the Nimblegen wash buffer kit. 4) Array scanning using the Axon GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Molecular Devices Corporation).  Scanned images (TIFF format) were then imported into NimbleScan software (version 2.5) for grid alignment and expression data analysis. Expression data were normalized through quantile normalization and the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm included in the NimbleScan software.

Besides the CTCF/cohesin machinery, only a small set of nuclear factors have been studied for a direct role in physically connecting regulatory elements. Here, we show via acute degradation experiments that LDB1 directly and broadly promotes enhancer-promoter loops. Utilizing multiple degron systems, we demonstrate that most endogenous LDB1-mediated contacts can form in the absence of CTCF, cohesin and YY1. Furthermore, an engineered/forced, LDB1-driven chromatin loop can form in the absence of cohesin. Yet, in a fraction of cases cohesin driven extrusion may promote LDB1 anchored loops. Leveraging the dynamic reorganization of nuclear architecture during the transition from mitosis to G1 phase, we establish a relationship between LDB1-dependent interactions in the context of TAD organization and gene activation. Tri-C and Region Capture Micro-C reveal that LDB1 organizes multi-enhancer networks to activate transcription. This establishes LDB1 as direct driver of connectivity between regulatory elements.","Sitravatinib is an immunomodulatory tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can improve responses when combined with immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). We conducted a phase I trial to determine the optimal dose of triplet therapy with sitravatinib plus nivolumab plus ipilimumab in 22 previously untreated patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The primary endpoint was safety. The addition of even a low sitravatinib dose of 35 mg daily to nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg resulted in high frequency of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Subsequent dose reduction of ipilimumab to 0.7 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg allowed safe escalation of sitravatinib up to 100 mg daily. Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Overall, the triplet combination in the dose-finding setting achieved an ORR of 45.5%, DCR of 86.4%, and a median PFS of 14.5 months with 72.7% of patients alive after a median follow-up of 15.7 months. Single-cell RNA-seq performed in longitudinally collected tumor biopsies from 12 patients treated with the triplet therapy identified a tumor cell-specific epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like program associated with treatment resistance and poor outcomes in patients of this trial and in patients of the TCGA ccRCC cohort. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), the emergence of treatment resistance was characterized by a transition from cytotoxic to exhausted T cell state and enrichment for M2-like myeloid cells. The observed changes in gene expression dynamics and cellular states in tumor cell and TME may help inform future strategies to optimize ICT efficacy.","Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) development is characterized by an altered DNA methylation landscape, which presents a promising area for developing MPNST‐specific biomarkers for screening patients with NF1. Genome‐wide DNA methylation profiling of a cohort of 13 patients with MPNST (29 samples of tumor and adjacent neurofibroma tissues) and of NF1‐MPNST cell lines was performed to identify and validate candidate MPNST‐specific CpG sites (CpGs). A logistic regression prediction model was constructed to select MPNST‐specific CpGs distinct from adjacent neurofibromas and normal tissues. To test if hypermethylation at selected CpGs can also be detected in plasma from patients with MPNST, cfMBD‐seq was applied to profile the cfDNA methylome of blood from patients with MPNST and NF1. Based on stringent feature‐selection criteria and predictive modeling, we identified 73 candidate MPNST‐specific CpGs (67 with unique CpG island locations) that reliably discriminated MPNSTs from neurofibromas. Validation of five candidate biomarkers confirmed successful MPNST detection (sensitivity: &gt; 88%, specificity: &gt; 91%) in tissues. In plasma samples, 63 of 67 selected genomic regions had greater than 1.2‐fold higher methylation in patients with MPNST than those with NF1. Further, we identified 15 CpG islands that consistently separated plasma from patients with confirmed MPNST diagnosis from plasma of individuals with NF1 without a diagnosis of malignant transformation (FDR &lt; 0.1). Our findings confirmed a unique hypermethylation pattern present during malignant transformation. This study highlights the potential to be further investigated further as biomarkers in clinical settings for early MPNST detection in patients with NF1.","Transcriptomic analysis delineated the interactions between NPC cells and macrophages through exosome cargos. The findings revealed that NPC cells modulated macrophage polarization via exosomes, thereby promoting tumor progression","Here, we examined the effect of LDN-193189, an inhibitor of the BMP signaling pathway, on pig embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the absence of feeder cells to develop a feeder-free culture system. Feeder cells play an important role in supporting the pluripotency of pig ESCs by blocking trophoblast and mesodermal differentiation through inhibition of the BMP pathway. Transcriptome analysis revealed that LDN-193189 treatment instead of coculturing with feeder cells could help maintain the pluripotency and homogenous cell population of pig ESCs by stimulating the secretion of chemokines and suppressing differentiation. We confirmed that LDN-193189-treated pig ESCs cultured without feeder cells maintained pluripotency for an extended period and were capable of differentiating in vivo and in vitro. The pig ESCs represented distinct characteristics of pig epiblasts as an in vivo counterpart at a transcriptomic level. In summary, we developed feeder-free culture systems for pig ESCs, and our findings will improve the understanding of pluripotency gene networks and comparative embryogenesis.","We deciphered molecular mechanisms associated with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR targeted therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) by comparing gene expression profiles in cetuximab-sensitive and -resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of HNSCC. We generated and validated several HNSCC PDX models. Resistance mechanisms to anti-EGFR therapy were investigated in one of these PDX models (UCLHN04). First, sensitivity to cetuximab treatment was tested. This model showed high sensitivity to this drug. We induced acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in this sensitive model by treating it chronically with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (cetuximab, 30 mg/kg/week) until resistance ensues. RNA-seq analysis was performed on samples coming from untreated and cetuximab-resistant PDX, revealing major changes of expression at the mRNA level.","Human cancer cell lines constitute useful models to model the primary disease and many relevant findings in tumor biology have been originated from them since the first immortalized cell line (HeLa) was obtained. The easy experimental intervention, the purity of the transformed cells and their versatility to undergo high-throughput screenings represent advantageous features of the established cancer cell lines. Herein, we have obtained the DNA methylation profiles of 210 cell lines derived from hematological malignancies utilizing comprehensive DNA methylation microarrays that interrogate more than 850,000 and 285,000 CpG sites from human and mouse genomes, respectively.","After spinal cord injury (SCI), macrophages engage in the phagocytosis of myelin debris and dead cells, transforming into foam cells. Nevertheless, the ultimate fate and functional role of these foam cells remain unclear, while their inflammatory phenotype elicits ongoing controversy. We discovered that macrophages transform into foam cells through 3 stages, which were phagocytosis, digestion, and lipid overload. Macrophages possess a certain degree of antioxidant capacity. When confronted with excessive lipid pressure, they undergo lipid droplets formation and metabolic reprogramming to alleviate lipotoxicity, also promoting angiogenesis. The anti-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages gradually diminished after SCI, phagocytosing debris could assist in maintaining this phenotype. Moreover, most genes expression patterns were conserved both in the SCI mice and rats. Our study provides a detailed description of the changes in gene expression and function during foam cell formation and long-term fate after SCI, which provides a theoretical basis for further research.","The Open Problems Perurbation Prediction (OP3) dataset is to-date the largest single-cell small molecule perturbation dataset in primary tissue with multiple donor replicates. Compounds are dosed in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), enabling the robust computation of perturbation effects on gene expression across four distinct cell type populations: T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and Myeloid cells. This dataset is the basis for the OP3 benchmark, which evaluates machine learning models on the task of extrapolation perturbation effects into unseen cell types.","To understand the molecular events underlying seed desiccation and germination, we performed transcriptome analysis of soybean (Glycine max) embryos at three seed developmental stages (early, mid and late desiccation), mature dry seeds, and three germination stages (3, 16 and 27 hour-after-imbibition)."," Understanding the temporal dynamics of the esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) ecosystem during chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is key for improving the low clinical response rates. Here, we report single cell RNA-seq data of 302,035 cells from 83 longitudinal samples collected from 47 patients to study both pre-existing programs and reprogramed cells that are associated with CRT responses. CRT good-responders showed a lymphoid-activated ecotype with higher tumor-reactive lymphoid cells and activation of interferon pathways. The cancer cells from good-responders showed increased proliferation, while non-responders had higher zinc metabolism programs before CRT. Longitudinally, we found large expansions of myeloid cells during CRT and persistent inflammation in the worse responders. Additionally, the upregulation of gastric subtype expression programs on cancer cells during CRT was strongly associated with non-responders. Collectively, this study provides insights into the biology of CRT responses and identifies novel biomarkers and actionable targets to enhance CRT efficacy in patients.","Mammalian kidney has very limited ability to repair or regenerate after acute kidney injury (AKI). The maladaptive repair of AKI promotes the progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, it is extremely urgent to explore new strategies to promote the repair/regeneration of injured renal tubules after AKI. It has been shown that hypoxia induces heart regeneration in adult mice. However, it is unknown whether hypoxia can induce kidney regeneration after AKI. In this study, we used a prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitor (PHDI), MK-8617, to mimic hypoxia condition and found that MK-8617 significantly ameliorates ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) induced acute kidney injury. We then showed that MK-8617 dramatically facilitates renal regeneration via promoting the proliferation of injured renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) after IRI-induced AKI. We then performed bulk mRNA sequencing and discovered that multiple nephrogenesis- related genes were significantly upregulated with MK-8617 pretreatment. Furthermore, we showed that MK-8617 may alleviate proximal tubule injury via stabilizing HIF-1α protein specifically in renal proximal tubular cells. We also demonstrated that MK-8617 promotes the reprogramming of renal proximal tubular cells to Sox9+ renal progenitor cells, and the regeneration of renal proximal tubules. In summary, we discovered that inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase improves renal proximal tubule regeneration after IRI-induced AKI via promoting the reprogramming of renal proximal tubular cells to Sox9+ renal progenitor cells.","Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging allows for the study of metabolic activity in the tumor microenvironment of brain cancers. The detectable metabolites within these tumors are contingent upon the choice of matrix, deposition technique, and polarity setting. In this study, we compared the performance of three different matrices, two deposition techniques, and the use of positive and negative polarity in two different brain cancer types and across two species. Optimal combinations were confirmed by a comparative analysis of lipid and small-molecule abundance by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing to assess differential metabolites and enzymes between normal and tumor regions. Our findings indicate that in the tumor-bearing brain, the recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix with positive polarity offered superior performance for both detected metabolites and consistency with other techniques. Beyond these implications for brain cancer, our work establishes a workflow to identify optimal matrices for spatial metabolomics studies.","Background: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) maintain tissue homeostasis in response to microenvironmental perturbations. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key sensors for exogenous and endogenous signals produced during injury. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether TLRs affect the homeostatic functions of MSCs after injury. Methods: We examined the expression of TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 in MSCs, and analyzed the functional significance of TLR2 activation using single-cell RNA sequencing. Additionally, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of TLR2 and its downstream activation in MSCs on monocytes/macrophages and a mouse model of sterile injury-induced inflammatory corneal angiogenesis.  Results: MSCs expressed TLR2, which was upregulated by monocytes/macrophages. Activation of TLR2 in MSCs promoted their immunoregulatory and angiostatic functions in monocytes/macrophages and in mice with inflammatory corneal angiogenesis, whereas TLR2 inhibition attenuated these functions. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed AKR1C1, a gene encoding aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1, as the most significantly inducible gene in MSCs upon TLR2 stimulation, though its stimulation did not affect cell compositions. AKR1C1 protected MSCs against ferroptosis, increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced their ability to drive monocytes/macrophages towards immunoregulatory phenotypes, leading to amelioration of inflammatory corneal neovascularization in mice.  Conclusion: Our findings suggest that activation of TLR2-AKR1C1 signaling in MSCs serves as an important pathway for MSCs’ survival and homeostatic activities during injury.","Like other functional RNAs, ribozymes contain a conserved catalytic center supported by peripheral domains that vary among ribozyme sub-families. To understand how core-peripheral interactions contribute to ribozyme fitness, we compared the cleavage kinetics of all single base substitutions at 152 sites across the Bacillus subtilis glmS ribozyme by high-throughput sequencing (ClvSeq). The in vitro activity map mirrored phylogenetic sequence conservation in glmS ribozymes, indicating that biological fitness reports all biochemically important positions. Most deleterious mutations impaired RNA self-assembly. All-atom MD simulations of the complete ribozyme revealed how individual mutations in the core or the IL4 peripheral loop rewire the network of hydrogen bonds around the catalytic site. Remarkably, IL4 mutations introduce a non-native helix interface that corrupts folding of the wild type core, eliminating activity. The results illustrate how competition between native and non-native structures in RNA drives the natural selection of central and peripheral tertiary interaction motifs.","To investigate the effect of mutant p53 Y220C acetylation in gene expression, we treated BxPC3 (p53Y220C/-) cell lines with either DMSO, or PK9328 or MS172.","The differentiation of primary human megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP) into  megakaryocytic (Mk) or erythroid (E) progenitors is critical for maintaining the blood  system, yet the mechanisms that regulate this fate specification remain unclear. Here,  we analyzed RNA-seq data and found that RUNX1 is a key regulator of differential gene  expression in MEP fate specification. Through viral transduction of primary MEP with  RUNX1, we demonstrated that overexpression of RUNX1 promotes Mk over E  specification, whereas pan-RUNX inhibition promotes E fate specification over Mk. We  found that although the levels of total RUNX1 do not differ between MkP and ErP, MkP  have higher levels of RUNX1 phosphorylated serine residues, and that serine/threonine  phosphorylation of RUNX1 dramatically increases its effectiveness. We used human  erythroleukemia (HEL) cell lines with expression of HA-tagged WT RUNX1,  phosphomimetic (RUNX1-4D) and non-phosphorylatable (RUNX1-4A) mutants to model  their effects on MEP. Although the chromatin association was not informative, the three  forms of RUNX1 caused differential expression of 2,625 genes. Approximately 40% of  these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed an increase with both RUNX1-WT  and RUNX1-4D while another 40% showed a decrease with both RUNX1-WT and  RUNX1-4D. We compared these DEGs with DEGs from primary human MEP, Mk  progenitors (MkP), and E progenitors (ErP), and found that the genes upregulated by  WT and RUNX1-4D in HEL cells overlapped significantly with the genes upregulated in  MkP vs. MEP, whereas genes downregulated by WT and RUNX1-4D in HEL cells  overlapped significantly with the genes downregulated in MkP vs. MEP. These results  suggest that phosphorylation of RUNX1 enhances RUNX1’s function to activate or  repress transcription of target genes that are up/downregulated during MEP fate  specification.","Omics analyses and qRT-PCR time-course during the transition from hiPSC to hiPSC-NSC highlighted the up-regulation of SREBF1, a gene involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid homeostasis, suggesting its potential role in NSC commitment/maintenance. To test this hypothesis, we generated SREBF1-deficient hiPSC lines by co-delivering ribonucleoprotein Cas9 with a pool of sgRNA targeting exon 5 of the SREBF1 gene. Upon isolation of three clones harboring the deletion we performed RNA-seq analysis in hiPSC, hiPSC-NSC and differentiated cultures at 7 and 14 days of differentiation, compared to control cells. This analysis will allow to identify the potential role of SREBF1 in affecting hiPSC-to-hiPSC-NSC transition, hiPSC-NSC maintenance and commitment toward differentiated cell populations.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","We reported the application of 21 human induced pluripotent stem cells and 2 human embryonic stem cells to establish a perdiciton model for disease affected tissues","Copper is an essential trace element, but can become toxic when present in abundance. The severe effects of copper-metabolism imbalance are illustrated by the inherited disorders Wilson disease and Menkes disease. The Labrador retriever dog breed is a novel non-rodent model for copper-storage defects displaying identical phenotypic alterations and carrying mutations in genes known to be involved in copper transport. Besides disease initiation and progression of copper accumulation, the molecular mechanisms and pathways involved in copper accumulation and eventually progression towards copper associated chronic hepatitis still remains unclear. Using liver tissue of Labrador retrievers in different stages of copper-associated hepatitis, expression levels targeted at candidate genes as well as transcriptome microarrays, have shed light on involved molecular pathways. At the initial phase, viz. increased hepatic copper levels, transcriptomic alterations in livers revealed enrichment for cell adhesion, developmental, inflammatory, and cytoskeleton pathways. Upregulation of targeted MT1A and COMMD1 mRNA shows the livers first response to rising intrahepatic copper concentrations. In livers with copper-associated hepatitis mainly an activation of inflammatory pathways is detected. Once the hepatitis is in the chronic stage, transcriptional differences are found in cell adhesion adaptations and cytoskeleton remodelling. In view of the high similarities in hepatopathies between men and dog extrapolation of these dog data into human biomedicine seems feasible.","The genome-wide analysis of T lympocytes from 24 MLD patients and a corresponding number of matched controls reveals a list of differentially expressed genes that can be used to build classifiers that correctly classify not only patients and controls with high sensitivity and specificity, but also MLD patients into early- and late-onset clinical classes. Among the most differentially expressed genes, the class of metallothioneins shows a consistent and significant over-expression, confirmed also in affected tissues of patients and mouse models of MLD and other Lysosomal Storage Disorders, indicating metallothioneins a novel dynamic biomarker of disease progression and treatment response in this class of diseases. Moreover, gene onthology analysis performed on the microarray data suggest an involvement of stress response- and autophagy-related pathways as pathological mechanisms in MLD.","Diff_d14_Ctrl_rep3","Diff_d14_Ctrl_rep2","Diff_d14_Ctrl_rep1","Diff_d14_SREBF1KO_clone34","Diff_d14_SREBF1KO_clone15","Diff_d14_SREBF1KO_clone8","Diff_d7_Ctrl_rep3","Diff_d7_Ctrl_rep2","Diff_d7_Ctrl_rep1","Diff_d7_SREBF1KO_clone34","Diff_d7_SREBF1KO_clone15","Diff_d7_SREBF1KO_clone8","NSC_Ctrl_rep3","NSC_Ctrl_rep2","NSC_Ctrl_rep1","Omics analyses and qRT-PCR time-course during the transition from hiPSC to hiPSC-NSC highlighted the up-regulation of SREBF1, a gene involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid homeostasis, suggesting its potential role in NSC commitment/maintenance.

Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs available that slow NASH progression or address NASH liver involvement in COVID-19. Since animal models cannot fully recapitulate human NASH, we hypothesized that stem cells isolated directly from end-stage NASH patient liver may address current knowledge gaps in human NASH pathology.  Approach and Results: We devised methods allowing derivation, proliferation, hepatic differentiation and extensive characterization of bipotent ductal organoids from irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver. The transcriptomes of organoids derived from NASH liver, but not healthy liver show significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory and cytochrome p450-related pathways, as well as of known liver fibrosis and tumor markers, with the degree of upregulation being NASH patient-specific.","Deferasirox (DFX) is an oral iron chelator used to reduce iron overload caused by frequent red blood cell transfusions in anemic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. To study molecular mechanisms by which DFX improves outcome in MDS, we analyzed  gene expression patterns in MDS patients before and after DFX therapy.","Translational stop codon readthrough generates C-terminally extended protein isoforms. While evidence mounts of readthrough as a global phenomenon, proofs of its functional consequences are scarce. We show that readthrough of the Drosophila POU/Oct transcription factor gene drifter (dfr) occurs at a high rate and in a spatiotemporal manner in vivo, reaching more than 50% in the larval prothoracic gland. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that readthrough of dfr is conserved among Dipterans, with C-terminal extensions harboring intrinsically disordered regions and amino acids streches implied in transcriptional activation. The extended Dfr isoform is required for maintaining normal levels of the growth hormone ecdysone through regulation of its biosynthetic genes, acting in synergy with the transcription factor Molting defective (Mld). A 14-bp deletion that abolished readthrough, caused prolonged larval development and delayed metamorphosis. This study provides a striking example of alternative genetic decoding that feeds into the progression from one life cycle stage to another.","Odorants in the environment that can cross the cell membrane are likely important detection targets for a conserved pathway and using one such odorant, diacetyl, we show that the ancient family of histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) can act as an atypical odorant detection pathway. Based on our testing we demonstrate that this response meets 6 characteristics of an odor-sensing pathway to odorant exposure: (1) a highly specific response to volatile compounds by altering gene expression, (2) differential modulation of different HDACs, (3) dose-dependent response in vitro, (4) dose-dependent response in vivo, (5) reversible to some degree, and (6) highly conserved across eukaryotes such as invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. We observe that exposure to diacetyl vapors modulates gene expression over a period of days in the Drosophila antenna. The up-regulated genes significantly overlap with genes altered by known histone deacetylase inhibitors administered in the food. In vitro assays with purified human proteins showed that different members of  class I HDACs are differentially inhibited. Moreover exposure to diacetyl increased histone H3K4 acetylation in a human cell line. Organisms spanning multiple taxa can respond to diacetyl volatiles by altering gene expression, presumably in part via inhibition of histone deacetylase proteins causing epigenetic changes. Our finding reveals a highly conserved and slow-acting pathway for responding to odorants beyond the fast-acting neuronal activation via transmembrane receptors, and raises questions about the effects of this odorant detection pathway on physiology and health of organisms.","To further examine the mechanisms of urate in islet β-cell death, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish primacy of streptozotocin (STZ) vs. urate. Islets were isolated from Uox-KO and WT mice with and without multiple low-dose STZ.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play multiple roles in hematopoiesis, contributing to the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies and representing a new class of biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We aimed to characterize lncRNAs deregulated in MDS that may function in the disease pathogenesis and those that could serve as novel potential biomarkers of the disease. We performed a microarray expression profiling of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes (PCGs) in CD34+ bone marrow cells of MDS patients. Expression profiles were generated to analyze lncRNA expression with relation to different aspects of the disease (i.e., diagnosis, disease subtypes, cytogenetic and mutational aberrations, and risk of progression).","PC9 cells (untreated or treated with 4D combo) were harvested (in trizol) 48h or 72h after 4D combo treatment in replicates.","47,880 probe-sets were screened, in the first part of this study, they were analysed for correlation of transcripts levels with body composition traits","Microarray gene expression profiling to identify differentially regulated genes in Musculus longissimus dorsi (MLD) of Japanese Black (JB) steers compared to Holstein steers (HS)","The purpose of this experiment was to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in IHH cells infected with Zaire Ebola virus and mutants: Zaire Ebola virus: This wild-type Ebola virus - strain Mayinga - was isolated from a fatal human case in Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1976 Zaire Ebola virus, VP35 R312A possesses a R312A mutation in the VP35 protein.

We used microarrays to analyse the response untreated and moderate light and drought stress in aox1a mutants, rpoTmp  mutants and aox1a:rpoTmp double mutants. This was analysed in paralell with WT (Col0) plants in order to identify the responses to stress.","The genome-wide analysis of T lympocytes from 24 MLD patients and a corresponding number of matched controls reveals a list of differentially expressed genes that can be used to build classifiers that correctly classify not only patients and controls with high sensitivity and specificity, but also MLD patients into early- and late-onset clinical classes. Among the most differentially expressed genes, the class of metallothioneins shows a consistent and significant over-expression, confirmed also in affected tissues of patients and mouse models of MLD and other Lysosomal Storage Disorders, indicating metallothioneins a novel dynamic biomarker of disease progression and treatment response in this class of diseases. Moreover, gene onthology analysis performed on the microarray data suggest an involvement of stress response- and autophagy-related pathways as pathological mechanisms in MLD.","To investigate the transcriptomic profile and molecular machnisiums using RNA sequecning analysis for the iPSC derived neural cells and brain organoids from the patient of Alpers’ Disease We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of the iPSC derived neural cells and brain organoids from the patient of Alpers’ Disease and healthy controls","The biology underlying nodal metastasis is poorly understood. Transcriptome profiling has helped to characterize both primary tumors seeding nodal metastasis and the metastasis themselves. The interpretation of these data, however, is not without ambiguities. Here we profiled the transcriptomes of 17 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) nodal metastases, associated primary tumors and primary tumors from N0 patients. We also included patient-matched normal thyroid and lymph node samples as controls to address some limits of previous studies. We found that the transcriptomes of patient-matched primary tumors and metastases were more similar than of unrelated metastases/primary pairs, a result also reported in other organ systems, and that part of this similarity reflected patient background. We found that the comparison of patient-matched primary tumors and metastases was heavily confounded by the presence of lymphoid tissues in the metastasis samples. An original data adjustment procedure was developed to circumvent this problem. It revealed a differential expression of stroma-related gene expression signatures also regulated in other organ systems. The comparison of N0 vs. N+ primary tumors uncovered a signal irreproducible across independent PTC datasets. This signal was also detectable when comparing the normal thyroid tissues adjacent to N0 and N+ tumors, suggesting a cohort specific bias also likely to be present in previous studies with similar statistical power. Classification of N0 vs. N+ yielded an accuracy of 63%, but additional statistical controls not presented in previous studies, revealed that this is likely to occur by chance alone. To address this issue, we used large datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and showed that N0 vs. N+ classification rates could not be reached randomly for most cancers. Yet, it was significant, but of limited accuracy (&lt;70%) for thyroid, breast and head and neck cancers.","14-PT-N1,Papillary thyroid carcinoma,N1","14-LNM,Lymph node metastasis,N1","14-N,Normal thyroid,N1","The tongue facilitates vital activities such as swallowing. Swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) are common in the elderly and in many adult-onset neuromuscular diseases. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), dysphagia is often the first symptom. OPMD is an autosomal dominant myopathy caused by a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the gene encoding PABPN1. The expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble nuclear aggregates that reduce the levels of the soluble form. Clinical tongue involvement in OPMD has been documented but is poorly understood. Tongue histopathology was investigated in OPMD mouse models using light and electron microscopy. Muscle histopathology was predominantly affected by age. PABPN1 nuclear aggregates were found at moderate levels, whereas deposition of insoluble PABPN1 in blood vessels was already prominent in 4-month-old mice. RNA signatures of the OPMD tongue were enriched for mitochondrial and cytoskeletal genes, suggesting an energy and contractile deficit.  ","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide1,2. HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulated progressive driver mutations3, with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin2. However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is independent of the underlying aetiologies4.  Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations5,6. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC7. We generated over twenty-five new genetically-driven in vivo and in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance, and metastasis to distant organs. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human-mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with histopathology.  In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard of care treatment and used a linked in vitro-in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not been linked to HCC treatment before. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard of care therapy.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide.

PDAC generally shows strong chemoresistance, which has been correlated with the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDAC consisting of various types of stromal cells. Recent single-cell RNA sequence (scRNAseq) analyses demonstrate that a high percentage of myeloid cells in TME stroma cells is related to poor prognosis, and, among myeloid cells, tumor associated macrophages (TAM) are the most abundant population. However, their functions in PDAC malignancy remain largely unknown. Previously, we established a PDAC-organoid associated with an artificial TME by co-culturing patient-derived cancer cells, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived mesenchymal and endothelial cells, which is called fused pancreatic cancer organoid (FPCO). Here, we further incorporated macrophages into FPCO and named it M0-FPCO. After 1 week of organoid culture, the macrophages in M0-FPCO expressed the conventional markers of M2-macrophages, such as CD163 and CD206. However, bulk RNAseq analysis showed that macrophages in M0-FPCO (FPCO-Mac) have distinct characteristics as compared with M2-macrophages induced with IL4 and 13. scRNAseq of M0-FPCO further demonstrated that FPCO-Mac was divided into 6 populations including Granulin+-TAM and SPP1+-TAM, which had been identified in human PDAC tissue. Furthermore, the number of PDAC cells was reduced in FPCO but not in M0-FPCO between 1 and 2 weeks of organoid culture, suggesting that cancer cells could survive longer or are protected from cell death in the presence of TAM. Moreover, the bulk-RNAseq analysis of the surviving M0-FPCO unveiled a GALE potentially associated with a worse prognosis in PDAC patients. Our novel PADC organoid including macrophage (M0-FPCO) replicated the PDAC-TAM features and elucidated their protumorigenic function.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a progressive cancer with only about 12 % of a 5-year survival rate.

Phenotypes of anoikis resistant cancer cells have been extensively investigated, however, how exposure to suspension stress may lead to acquisition of a anoikis resistance phenotype has not been previously described in detail.  Here we show using a spectrum of ovarian cancer cells, that cycles of suspension stress followed by attached growth, leads to adaptation and acquisition of resistance to cell death in suspension . Comparing the stepwise transcriptomic changes as cells acquire resistance, we find strong transcriptional reprogramming in the population with a majority of differentially expressed genes being downregulated during progressive acquisition of anoikis resistance. Adapted anoikis resistant cells display an enhanced dependency on oxidative phosphorylation and are capable of evasion from T cell-mediated immune surveillance. We find that such acquired anoikis resistance is not genetic. However, transcriptional reprogramming is essential to this process as acquisition of such adaptive anoikis resistance invitro and invivo are both exquisitely sensitive to specific inhibition of transcriptional reprogramming. Our data demonstrate that recovery from the verge of anoikis leads to adaptation that promotes metastasis in ovarian cancer, but can be therapeutically prevented by specific inhibitors to transcriptional reprogramming.","Background: Effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains an unmet need. Thus, identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at high-risk of progressing to AD is crucial for early intervention. Methods: Blood-based transcriptomics analyses were performed using a longitudinal study cohort to compare progressive MCI (P-MCI, n=28), stable MCI (S-MCI, n=39), and AD patients (n=49). Statistical DESeq2 analysis and machine learning methods were employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and develop prediction models. Results: We discovered a remarkable gender-specific difference in DEGs that distinguish P-MCI from S-MCI. Machine learning models achieved high accuracy in distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI (AUC 0.93), AD from S-MCI (AUC 0.94), and AD from P-MCI (AUC 0.92). An 8-gene signature was identified for distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI.","Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor and non-motor symptoms. People with PD often present with gastrointestinal dysfunction, such as constipation, and studies have indicated that PD is more common in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) are responsible for approximately 1% of all PD cases and increased risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among them, the LRRK2 Gly2019Ser is the most common PD-associated mutation. It is unknown how LRRK2 mutation affects intestinal inflammation susceptibility or pathogenesis of PD. Here we demonstrate that LRRK2 G2019S mutation promotes increased neutrophils migration and differential gene regulation and cell function in these cells in Citrobacter rodentium-infected mice. We found a cell-intrinsic function for LRRK2 G2019S in vivo, in increasing neutrophil chemotaxis, degranulation and NETosis, and an upregulation of Th17 immune responses, which may together contribute to the observed increased colon pathology. Transcriptionally, these neutrophils have a greater pro-inflammatory type I and II IFN response compared to WT mice. Our results increase our understanding of the role of PD-associated genes in immune cells and their contribution to immune dysregulation, which could contribute to the development of pharmacological targets and biomarkers for an easier detection and intervention in PD.","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive respiratory scarring disease arising from the maladaptive differentiation of lung stem cells into bronchial epithelial cells rather than into alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, which are responsible for gas exchange. Here, we report that healthy lungs maintain their stem cells through tonic Hippo and β-catenin signaling, which promote Yap/Taz degradation and allow for low level expression of the Wnt target gene Myc. Inactivation of upstream activators of the Hippo pathway in lung stem cells inhibits this tonic β-catenin signaling and Myc expression and promotes their Taz-mediated differentiation into AT1 cells. Vice versa, increased Myc in collaboration with Yap promotes the differentiation of lung stem cells along the basal and myoepithelial like lineages allowing them to invade and bronchiolize the lung parenchyma in a process reminiscent of submucosal gland development. Our findings indicate that stem cells exhibiting the highest Myc levels become supercompetitors that drive remodeling, whereas loser cells with lower Myc levels terminally differentiate into AT1 cells","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron (MN) degenerative disease with a major pathological feature of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation. However, the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 proteinopathy are still largely unknown. We performed in vitro differentiation of ALS-induced pluripotent stem cells (ALS-iPSCs; carrying the TDP-43M337V mutation) and isogenic controls and found upregulation of paraspeckle-associated lncRNA NEAT1 isoforms in the ALS-iPSC-derived MNs (ALS-iPSC-MNs). Intriguingly, the upregulated NEAT1 isoforms were mislocalized to the cytoplasm of ALS-iPSC-MNs, and the cytoplasmic NEAT1 provoked TDP-43 and TDP-43M337V liquid-liquid phase separation, generating long-lived protein condensates. These condensates had reduced mobility and were converted into aggregates, finally co-aggregating with phospho-TDP-43. Disruption of NEAT1 expression reduced its cytoplasmic levels and also reduced the levels of TDP-43/TDP-43M337V condensates. In 3D neuromuscular organoids with the TDP-43M337V mutation, treatment with NEAT1-antisense oligonucleotides (NEAT1-ASO) promoted neuromuscular junction formation and function, as well as muscle contractility. Furthermore, treatment of TDP-43Q331K mice with Neat1-ASO attenuated TDP-43 pathology in spinal cord and preserved motor function. These findings suggest that NEAT1 plays an important role in TDP-43-associated pathology, and NEAT1-ASO may attenuate pathological TDP-43 aggregation to prevent motor neuron degeneration and muscle weakness in ALS.","High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) originates from fallopian tube (FT) precursors. However, the molecular changes that occur as precancerous lesions progress to HGSOC are not well understood. To address this, we integrated high-plex imaging and spatial transcriptomics to analyze human tissue samples at different stages of HGSOC development, including p53 signatures, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC), and invasive HGSOC. Our findings reveal immune modulating mechanisms within precursor epithelium, characterized by chromosomal instability, persistent interferon (IFN) signaling, and dysregulated innate and adaptive immunity. FT precursors display elevated expression of MHC-class I, including HLA-E, and IFN-stimulated genes, typically linked to later-stage tumorigenesis. These molecular alterations coincide with progressive shifts in the tumor microenvironment, transitioning from immune surveillance in early STICs to immune suppression in advanced STICs and cancer. These insights identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HGSOC interception and clarify the molecular transitions from precancer to cancer.","Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 226 longitudinally collected IDH-wildtype glioblastoma tumor specimens from 106 patients, consisting of 99 initial treatment-naive resection specimens prior to any radiation or chemotherapy and 127 recurrent post-treatment resection specimens at time of recurrence/progression usually following radiation and/or chemotherapy.  These 127 recurrent post-treatment resection specimens were composed of 106 first surgically-treated recurrent specimens, 19 second surgically-treated recurrent specimens, and 2 third surgically-treated recurrent specimens. The Illumina Infinium EPIC 850k version 1.0 Human DNA Methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 850,000 CpG sites of genomic DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue of the 226 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas.","Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 31 IDH-mutant astrocytoma tumor specimens, of which 14 are from initial surgical resections prior to any radiation or chemotherapy and 17 of which are from a second surgical resection at time of recurrence/progression usually following radiation and/or chemotherapy. For 7 patients (#201-#207), there are paired initial and recurrent tumor samples that were analyzed. For the remaining 17 patients, there are 7 (#208-#214) with only an initial tumor sample analyzed and 10 (#215-#224) with only a recurrent tumor sample analyzed. The Illumina Infinium EPIC 850k Human DNA Methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 850,000 CpG sites of genomic DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue of the 31 IDH-mutant astrocytomas.","Activating transcription factor 6 (Atf6) is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and is important for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function and protein homeostasis in metazoan cells. Patients carrying loss-of-function ATF6 disease alleles develop the cone dysfunction disorder, achromatopsia.  The impact of loss of ATF6 function on other cell types, organs, and diseases in people remains unclear. Here, we reported that progressive sensorineural hearing loss was a notable complaint in some patients carrying ATF6 disease alleles and that Atf6-/- mice also showed progressive auditory deficits affecting both genders.  In mice with hearing deficits, we found disorganized stereocilia on hair cells and focal loss of outer hair cells.  Transcriptomic analysis of Atf6-/- cochleae revealed marked induction of UPR, especially through the PERK arm.  These findings identify ATF6 as an essential regulator of cochlear health and function.  Furthermore, they supported that ATF6 inactivation in people causes progressive sensorineural hearing loss as part of a blindness-deafness genetic syndrome targeting hair cells and cone photoreceptors.  Lastly, our genetic findings support ER stress as an important pathomechanism underlying cochlear damage and hearing loss with clinical implications for patient lifestyle modifications that minimize environmental/physiologic sources of ER stress to the ear.","Emphysema is a major pathological phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that is characterized by progressive and irreversible alveolar tissue destruction caused by several stressors, such as tobacco smoke and air pollution. It remains incurable in part due to an incomplete understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the failure of tissue repair. Here, we have generated a single cell RNA sequencing dataset of enriched epithelial cells from emphysematous parenchymal lung tissue of COPD patients and from healthy controls.  Using this dataset, we performed high resolution analysis of 78,699 ATII cells and reveal novel ATII cell subsets in severe emphysema and health. These include two ATII sub-clusters expressing various secretoglobin mRNAs (SCGBpos) in COPD that present distinct transcriptomic profiles compared to healthy sub-clusters. These ATII sub-clusters that are present in human COPD are also found in a mouse emphysema model.  Importantly, the COPD specific ATII cells from both species demonstrate airway origins and fail to undergo alveolar differentiation in organoid cultures, thereby suggesting that a common mechanism in emphysema pathogenesis.","Systemic autoimmunity is driven by the production of pathogenic autoantibodies that can arise from germinal centers (GCs). Typically, B cells that acquire autoreactivity following somatic hypermutation in the GC die of neglect, but in autoimmunity these autoreactive clones still receive T cell help, driving aberrant selection. GC B cells cycle between the dark zone (DZ), where proliferation and mutation occur, and the light zone (LZ) where selection occurs. Temporal assessment comparing GCs from mice with chronic infection or lupus revealed a shared accumulation of LZ B cells while lupus GC B cells had a unique reduction in proliferation and a progressive loss of MYC and FOXO1 in lupus. This loss in proliferative capacity coincided with a reduction in B cell receptor repertoire diversity and mutational burden. Furthermore, we identified persistent dominant GC B cell clones associated with an expansion in plasma cell differentiation throughout disease. Together, our findings suggest that lupus disease progression is characterized by an inability for proper LZ selection, preventing zonal recycling, thereby driving the permissive selection and differentiation of autoreactive B cells.","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal progressive lung disease urgently needing new therapies. Current treatments only delay disease progression, leaving lung transplant as the sole remaining option. Recent studies support a model whereby IPF arises because alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) cells, which normally mediate distal lung regeneration, acquire airway and/or mesenchymal characteristics, preventing proper repair. Mechanisms driving this abnormal differentiation remain unclear. We performed integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of purified AT2 cells which revealed genome-wide alterations in IPF lungs. The most prominent epigenetic alteration was activation of an enhancer in thyroid receptor interactor 13 (TRIP13), coinciding with TRIP13 upregulation. TRIP13 is broadly implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and transforming growth factor-beta signaling. In cultured human AT2 cells and lung slices, small molecule TRIP inhibitor DCZ0415 prevented acquisition of the mesenchymal gene signature characteristic of IPF, suggesting TRIP13 inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach to fibrotic disease.","Background Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity (CIO), characterized by irreversible and progressive bilateral hearing loss, is a prevalent adverse effect of cisplatin chemotherapy. Alongside clinical risk factors, genetic variants contribute to CIO and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted the polygenicity of this adverse drug reaction. Polygenic scores (PGS), which integrate information from multiple genetic variants across the genome, offer a promising tool for the identification of individuals who are at higher risk for CIO. Integrating large-scale hearing loss GWAS data with single cell omics data holds potential to overcome limitations related to small sample sizes associated with CIO studies, enabling the creation of PGSs to predict CIO risk. Results We utilized a large-scale hearing loss GWAS and murine inner ear single nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data to develop two polygenic scores: a hearing loss PGS (PGSHL) and a biologically informed PGS for CIO (PGSCIO). The PGSCIO included only variants which mapped to genes that were differentially expressed within cochlear cells that showed differential abundance in the murine snRNA-seq data post-cisplatin treatment. Evaluation of the association of these PGSs with CIO in our target CIO cohort revealed that PGSCIO demonstrated superior performance (P = 5.54 × 10− 5) relative to PGSHL (P = 2.93 × 10− 3). PGSCIO was also associated with CIO in our test cohort (P = 0.04), while the PGSHL did not show a significant association with CIO (P = 0.52). Conclusion This study developed the first PGS for CIO using a large-scale hearing loss dataset and a biologically informed filter generated from cisplatin-treated murine inner ear snRNA-seq data. This innovative approach offers new avenues for developing PGSs for pharmacogenomic traits, which could contribute to the implementation of tailored therapeutic interventions. Further, our approach facilitated the identification of specific cochlear cells that may play critical roles in CIO. These novel insights will guide future research aimed at developing targeted therapeutic strategies to prevent CIO.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of late-life dementia characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and brain deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau. The APOE ε2 encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE2) is a protective allele against AD among the three genotypes (APOE ε2, ε3, ε4), while APOE4 is the strongest genetic factor substantially increasing AD risk. APOE regulates brain lipid homeostasis and maintaining synaptic plasticity and neuronal function, where APOE2 has a superior function compared to APOE3 and APOE4. Gene therapy that increases APOE2 levels in the brain is, therefore, a promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. We previously reported that PEGylated liposomes conjugated with transferrin and a cell-penetrating peptide Penetratin sufficiently deliver chitosan-APOE2 cDNA plasmid complex into the brain of wild-type mice. Here, we investigated how brain-targeting liposome-based APOE2 gene delivery influences Aβ)-related pathologies in amyloid model AppNL-G-F knockin mice at 12-month-old. We found a trend of reductions of insoluble Aβ levels in the mouse cortices 1 month after APOE2 gene therapy. Furthermore, in the AppNL-G-F knockin mice that received the APOE2 gene therapy, brain transcriptome analysis through RNA-sequencing identified the upregulation of genes/pathways related to neuronal development. This was supported by increases of Dlg4 and Syp mRNAs coding synaptic proteins in the experimental group. On the other hand, we found that APOE2 gene delivery increased soluble Aβ levels, including oligomers, as well as exacerbated neurite dystrophy and decreased synaptophysin. Together, our results suggest that brain-targeting liposome-based APOE2 gene therapy is potentially beneficial for synaptic formation at the transcriptional level. Forced APOE2 expressions, however, may exacerbate Aβ toxicity by increasing the dissociation of Aβ oligomers from aggregates in the presence of considerable amyloid burden.","The steady rise of sepsis globally has reached almost 49 million cases in 2017, and 11 million sepsis-related deaths. The genomic response to sepsis comprising multi-system stage of raging microbial inflammation has been reported in the whole blood, while effective treatment is lacking besides anti-microbial therapy and supportive measures. Here we show that, astoundingly, 6,237 significantly expressed genes in sepsis are increased or decreased in the lungs, the site of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Moreover, 5,483 significantly expressed genes in sepsis are increased or decreased in the kidneys, the site of acute injury (AKI). This massive genomic response to polymicrobial sepsis is countered by the selective nuclear blockade with the cell-penetrating Nuclear Transport Checkpoint Inhibitor (NTCI). It controlled 3,735 sepsis-induced genes in the lungs and 1,951 sepsis-induced genes in the kidneys. The NTCI also reduced without antimicrobial therapy the bacterial dissemination: 18-fold in the blood, 11-fold in the lungs, and 9-fold in the spleen. This enhancement of bacterial clearance was not significant in the kidneys. Cumulatively, identification of the sepsis-responsive host’s genes and their control by the selective nuclear blockade advances a better understanding of the multi-system mechanism of sepsis. Moreover, it spurs much-needed new diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approaches.","Large deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been linked to a variety of clinical pathologies, including somatic emergence in congenital disorders such as Pearson Syndrome (MIM:557000), a mitochondrial disease characterized by sideroblastic anemia and exocrine pancreas dysfunction. Here, we develop a multi-omics approach to quantify mtDNA deletion heteroplasmy and cell state features in thousands of single cells. By profiling primary hematopoietic cells from three patients with Pearson Syndrome, we resolve the interdependence between pathogenic mtDNA heteroplasmy and cell lineage, including purifying selection against mtDNA deletions in effector-memory CD8 T-cell populations. We further observe widespread Pearson-specific transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Additionally, single-cell analyses of in vivo and in vitro cultured bone marrow mononuclear cells reveal multi-faceted clonal dynamics and purifying selection in a patient with both Pearson Syndrome and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Our results identify specific molecular perturbations underlying Pearson Syndrome and more generally provide a powerful framework to utilize multi-omics in the study of evolution in disease within single cells.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below to reproduce the data and analyses from Lareau et al. 2023 Nature Genetics","Pathogenic mutations in either one of the epigenetic modifiers EHMT1, MBD5, MLL3, or SMARCB1 have been identified to be causative for Kleefstra syndrome spectrum (KSS), a neurodevelopmental disorder with clinical features of both intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To understand how these variants lead to the phenotypic convergence in KSS, we employ a loss-of-function approach to assess neuronal network development at the molecular, single-cell, and network activity level. KSS-gene-deficient neuronal networks all develop into hyperactive networks with altered network organization and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Interestingly, even though transcriptional data reveal distinct regulatory mechanisms, KSS target genes share similar functions in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic function, several of which are associated with ID and ASD. Our results show that KSS genes mainly converge at the level of neuronal network communication, providing insights into the pathophysiology of KSS and phenotypically congruent disorders.","Acute unilateral vestibulopathy (AUV) is the third most common peripheral vestibular disorder after BPPV and Meniere’s disease. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the etiology of AUV including viral infection, vascular occlusion, and autoimmune disease, but the exact pathogenesis still remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of AUV using the gene expression profiling combined with bioinformatic analysis.","Purpose: To develop a pipeline (Splice-Break) for high-resolution quantification of mtDNA deletions, provide a catalogue of human mtDNA deletion breakpoints, and evaluate mtDNA deletions in brains from subjects with psychiatric disorders. Methods: 93 samples from human postmortem brain and blood were obtained from the Southwest Brain Bank (SBB) and University of California, Irvine (UCI) Brain Bank. Total DNA was extracted from frozen homogenate tissue and mtDNA was amplified/enriched using a single long-range PCR. Mitochondrial amplicons were purified by bead purification to retain both wild-type and deleted molecules (i.e., no gel excision was performed). mtDNA-enriched PCR amplicons were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols for DNA. Samples were sequenced 150-mer paired-end reads, in multiplex (96x per lane), on an unpatterned flowcell (HiSeq 2500). Fastq files were processed using our Splice-Break pipeline for the detection and relative quantification of mtDNA deletions. Results: A catalogue of 4,489 putative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions, including their frequency and relative read rate, was produced. Analyses of 93 samples from postmortem brain and blood found 1) the 4,977bp “common deletion” was neither the most frequent deletion nor the most abundant; 2) brain contained significantly more mtDNA deletions than blood; 3) many high frequency deletions were previously reported in MitoBreak, suggesting they are present at low levels in metabolically active tissues and are not exclusive to individuals with diagnosed mitochondrial pathologies; 4) many individual deletions (and cumulative deletion metrics) had significant and positive correlations with age; and 5) the highest deletion burdens were observed in a subset of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD), and these subjects had mtDNA deletion levels at or above those detected in typical deletion pathologies (e.g., Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) muscle). Conclusions: Collectively, these data suggest the Splice-Break pipeline can detect and quantify mtDNA deletions at a high level of resolution.","kidneys","kidneys","kidneys","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","peripheral whole blood","Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive disorder caused by insufficient expression of frataxin, which plays a critical role in assembly of iron-sulfur centers in mitochondria. Individuals are cognitively normal, but display a loss of motor coordination and cardiac abnormalities. Many ultimately succumb to heart failure. Administration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursors has shown promise in mitochondrial myopathy and rodent models of heart failure, including mice lacking frataxin in cardiomyocytes. We studied mice with systemic knockdown of frataxin (shFxn), which display motor deficits and early mortality with cardiac hypertrophy. Hearts in these mice do not “fail” per se but become hyperdynamic with small chamber sizes. Data from an ongoing natural history study indicate that hyperdynamic hearts are observed in young individuals with FRDA, suggesting that the mouse model could reflect early pathology. Administering nicotinamide mononucleotide or riboside to shFxn mice increases survival, modestly improves cardiac hypertrophy, and limits increases in ejection fraction. Mechanistically, most of the transcriptional and metabolic changes induced by frataxin knockdown are insensitive to NAD+ precursor administration, but glutathione levels are increased suggesting improved antioxidant capacity. Overall, our findings indicate that NAD+ precursors are modestly cardioprotective in this model of Friedreich’s Ataxia and warrant further investigation.","Transcriptional mitochondrial stress response to CHCHD10 G58R protein misfolding in mouse heart, gastrocnemius, and tibalis anterior muscle the presence and absence of the DELE1 mitochondrial integrated stress responses","Mitochondrial dysfunction causes devastating disorders, including mitochondrial myopathy. Here, we identified that diverse mitochondrial myopathy models elicit a protective mitochondrial integrated stress response (mt-ISR), mediated by OMA1-DELE1 signaling. The response was similar following disruptions in mtDNA maintenance, from knockout of Tfam, and mitochondrial protein unfolding, from disease-causing mutations in CHCHD10 (G58R and S59L). The preponderance of the response was directed at upregulating pathways for aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, the intermediates for protein synthesis, and was similar in heart and skeletal muscle but more limited in brown adipose challenged with cold stress. Strikingly, models with early DELE1 mt-ISR activation failed to grow and survive to adulthood in the absence of Dele1, accounting for some but not all of OMA1’s protection. Notably, the DELE1 mt-ISR did not slow net protein synthesis in stressed striated muscle, but instead prevented loss of translation-associated proteostasis in muscle fibers.

As neuromuscular tissues are highly energy-dependent, mitochondrial diseases often affect skeletal muscle. Although genetic and bioenergetic causes of OXPHOS impairment in human mitochondrial myopathies are well established, there is a limited understanding of metabolic drivers of muscle degeneration. This knowledge gap contributes to the lack of effective treatments for these disorders. Here, we discovered fundamental muscle metabolic remodeling mechanisms shared by mitochondrial disease patients and a mouse model of mitochondrial myopathy. This metabolic remodeling is triggered by a starvation-like response that evokes accelerated oxidation of amino acids through a truncated Krebs cycle. While initially adaptive, this response evolves in an integrated multiorgan catabolic signaling, lipid store mobilization, and intramuscular lipid accumulation. We show that this multiorgan feed-forward metabolic response involves leptin and glucocorticoid signaling. This study elucidates systemic metabolic dyshomeostasis mechanisms that underlie human mitochondrial myopathies and identifies potential new targets for metabolic intervention.","Large deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been linked to a variety of clinical pathologies, including somatic emergence in congenital disorders such as Pearson Syndrome (MIM:557000), a mitochondrial disease characterized by sideroblastic anemia and exocrine pancreas dysfunction. Here, we develop a multi-omics approach to quantify mtDNA deletion heteroplasmy and cell state features in thousands of single cells. By profiling primary hematopoietic cells from three patients with Pearson Syndrome, we resolve the interdependence between pathogenic mtDNA heteroplasmy and cell lineage, including purifying selection against mtDNA deletions in effector-memory CD8 T-cell populations. We further observe widespread Pearson-specific transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Additionally, single-cell analyses of in vivo and in vitro cultured bone marrow mononuclear cells reveal multi-faceted clonal dynamics and purifying selection in a patient with both Pearson Syndrome and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Our results identify specific molecular perturbations underlying Pearson Syndrome and more generally provide a powerful framework to utilize multi-omics in the study of evolution in disease within single cells.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below to reproduce the data and analyses from Lareau et al. 2023 Nature Genetics","Lysine-succinylation is a subtype of protein acylation associated with metabolic regulation of succinyl-CoA in the TCA cycle. Deficiency of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), the TCA-cycle enzyme catalyzing the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, leads to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy in humans and embryonic lethality in mice. This report presents a conditional forebrain-specific knock-out (KO0 mouse model of Sucla2, the gene encoding the ATP-specific beta isoform of SCS, resulting in postnatal deficiency of the entire SCS complex. Results demonstrate that the accumulation of succinyl-CoA in the absence of SCS leads to hyper-succinylation within the cerebral cortex of adult mice. With previous research identifying succinylation marks on histones, and with proteomic evidence of histone lysine-succinylation within the presented model, global chromatin accessibility was surveyed in Sucla2 mutant and control mice via ATAC-sequencing. Data show wide-scale alterations in chromatin landscape and global gene expression. Computational analysis of combined chromatin-accessibility and gene expression data reveal perturbation of neuronal transcriptional regulatory networks in the mutant forebrain, suggesting SCS-related changes in the protein succinylome and chromatin accessibility play a significant role in the neuronal pathogenesis of SCS-deficiency.","Lysine-succinylation is a subtype of protein acylation associated with metabolic regulation of succinyl-CoA in the TCA cycle.

To understand how this pathogenic variant affects the nervous system, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into excitatory neurons with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function from MELAS patients with the m.3243A&gt;G pathogenic variant. We combined micro-electrode array (MEA) measurements with RNA sequencing (MEA-seq) and found reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and presynaptic function, as well as non-cell autonomous processes in co-cultured astrocytes. Finally, we show that the clinical phase II drug sonlicromanol can improve neuronal network activity when treatment is initiated early in development. This was intricately linked with changes in the neuronal transcriptome. Overall, we provide insight in transcriptomic changes in iPSC-derived neurons with high m.3243A&gt;G heteroplasmy, and show the pathology is partially reversible by sonlicromanol.","Progressive mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) deficiency is associated with a wide spectrum of adult-onset degenerative diseases, as well as with normal aging. We have previously generated the Deletor mice to model late-onset progressive RC defects. Here we report novel tissue-specific pathways contributing to mitochondrial disease pathogenesis, identified by gene expression analysis. We found that RC-deficient muscle fibers secrete the fasting-induced hormone, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). This response leads to fatty acid recruitment from adipocytes and resistance to high-fat-diet induced obesity in mice, but does not affect glucose or insulin metabolism. FGF21 is also induced in the muscle of mitochondrial myopathy patients and in other RC-deficient mice. These data show that skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ, which signals its energy deficiency through FGF21. Furthermore, RC deficiency in single muscle fibers initiates a global starvation response. These data have important implications for conditions with primary or secondary RC deficiency.","Natural mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation plays a fundamental role in human disease and enables the clonal tracing of native human cells. While various genotyping approaches revealed mutational heterogeneity in human tissues and single cells, current methodologies are limited by scale. Here, we introduce a high-throughput, droplet-based mitochondrial single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (mtscATAC-seq) protocol and computational framework that facilitate high-confidence mtDNA mutation calling in thousands of single cells. Further, the concomitant high-quality accessible chromatin readout enables the paired inference of individual cell mtDNA heteroplasmy, clonal lineage, cell state, and accessible chromatin regulatory features. Our multi-omic analyses reveals single-cell variation in heteroplasmy of a pathologic mtDNA variant (m.8344A&gt;G), which we tie to intra-individual chromatin variability and clonal evolution. Further, using somatic mtDNA mutations, we clonally trace thousands of hematopoietic cells in vitro and in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, linking epigenomic variability to subclonal evolution in vivo. ","We obtained three independent sets of endothelial cells differentiated from iPSCs derived from a Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) patient as well as iPSCs that has been corrected for the mitochondrial mutation.","Purpose: We examined the impact of niacin on muscle gene expression in mitochondrial myopathy patients and healthy controls. Methods: Muscle transcriptomics profiles were generated using global transcriptomics analysis by RNA sequencing which was performed by the Beijing Genomic Institute (BGI) using their standard protocols Results: The pathway enrichment analysis of RNA-sequencing data indicated that phagosome formation, serine/glycine/one-carbon pathways (de novo serine biosynthesis, purine degradation, glutathione metabolism),  LXR/RXR activation, eicosanoid, glycoprotein 6, atherosclerosis, iron homeostasis and cAMP-mediated signalling pathways were among the most significantly changed in patients. Only five and two of the disease associated pathways remained significantly changed after 4- and 10-month supplementation, respectively, in patients as compared to controls. The most prominent niacin-related transcriptomic change in patients’ muscle (patient 10-months on niacin vs patient baseline) was wide-spread downregulation of mTOR-dependent cytoplasmic translation, involving a large number of cytoplasmic ribosome subunits as well as translation initiation factor eIF1. In patients, niacin activated also the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, known to induce mitochondrial biogenesis. Niacin also led to decreased atherosclerosis signaling including lowered apolipoprotein expression in patients. The healthy control muscles showed only few changes after 4-months of niacin. To examine in detail the effects of NAD-booster niacin in the mitochondrial integrated stress response (ISRmt),  we studied the effects NAD+ boosting for the expression of 24 ISRmt target genes in the patients’ muscle. The analysis confirmed wide-spread induction of these genes, but their expression was unaffected by niacin (ATF5 and its targets ASNS, TRIB3, FGF21, GDF15, MTHFD2, and MTHFD1L; de novo synthesis of serine, PSAT1, PHGDH and SHMT2;  glutathione metabolism GPX3 and GSR; and unfolded protein response ER CHOP). Conclusions: These results showed that niacin modulated the expression of disease associated pathways and suppressed mTOR signalling in patients but niacin did not affect disease-related ISRmt signalling.","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 3243A&gt;G tRNALeu(UUR) heteroplasmic mutation (m.3243A&gt;G) exhibits clinically heterogeneous phenotypes. While the high mtDNA heteroplasmy exceeding a critical threshold causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis with stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, the low mtDNA heteroplasmy causes maternally inherited diabetes with or without deafness (MIDD) syndrome. How quantitative differences in mtDNA heteroplasmy produces distinct pathological states has remained elusive. Here we show that despite striking similarities in the energy metabolic gene expression signature, the mitochondrial bioenergetics, biogenesis and fuel catabolic functions are distinct in cells harboring low or high levels of the m.3243A&gt;G mutation compared to wild type cells. We further demonstrate that the low heteroplasmic mutant cells exhibit a coordinate induction of transcriptional regulators of the mitochondrial biogenesis, glucose and fatty acid metabolism pathways that lack in near homoplasmic mutant cells compared to wild type cells. Altogether, these results shed new biological insights on the potential mechanisms by which low mtDNA heteroplasmy may progressively cause diabetes mellitus.","The liver, a pivotal organ in human metabolism, serves as a primary site for heme biosynthesis, critical for detoxification and drug metabolism. Maintaining precise control over heme production is paramount in healthy livers to meet high metabolic demands while averting potential toxicity from intermediate metabolites, notably protoporphyrin IX. Intriguingly, our recent research uncovers a disrupted heme biosynthesis process termed 'Porphyrin Overdrive' in cancers, fostering the accumulation of heme intermediates, potentially bolstering tumor survival. Here, we investigate heme and porphyrin metabolism in both healthy and oncogenic human livers, utilizing primary human liver transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Our investigations unveil robust gene expression patterns in heme biosynthesis in healthy livers, supporting electron transport chain (ETC) and cytochrome P450 function, devoid of intermediate accumulation. Conversely, liver cancers exhibit impaired heme biosynthesis and massive downregulation of cytochrome P450 expression. Notably, despite diminished drug metabolism, heme supply to the ETC remains largely unaltered or even elevated with cancer progression, suggesting a metabolic priority shift. Liver cancers selectively accumulate intermediates, absent in normal tissues, implicating their role in disease advancement as inferred by expression. Furthermore, our findings establish a link between diminished drug metabolism, augmented ETC function, porphyrin accumulation, and inferior overall survival in aggressive cancers, indicating potential targets for clinical therapy development.","Mutations in mitochondrial energy-producing genes lead to a heterogeneous group of untreatable disorders known as primary mitochondrial diseases (MD). Leigh syndrome (LS) is the most common pediatric MD and is characterized by progressive neuromuscular affectation and premature death. Here, we show that daily cannabidiol (CBD) administration significantly extends lifespan and ameliorates pathology in two LS mouse models, and cellular function in fibroblast from LS patients. CBD delays motor decline and neurodegenerative signs, improves social deficits and breathing abnormalities, decreases thermally induced seizures, and improves neuropathology in affected brain regions. Mechanistically, we identify peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) as a key contributor to CBD’s beneficial effects, and provide proof of dysregulated PPARg expression and activity as a common feature in both mouse neurons and fibroblasts from LS patients. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for CBD as a potential treatment for LS.","The generation of stem cell-derived beta-like cells (sBC) holds extreme promise as not only an abundant insulin-producing cell source for replacement therapy of Type 1 diabetes (T1D), but also as an invaluable model system for investigating human beta cell development, immunogenicity, and function. Several groups have developed methodology to direct differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into pancreatic cell populations that include glucose responsive sBC. Nevertheless, the process of generating sBC poses significant experimental challenges. It involves lengthy differentiation periods, experiences substantial variability in efficiency, and inconsistencies in obtaining functional sBC. Here, we described a simple and effective cryopreservation approach for sBC cultures that yields homogeneous sBC clusters that are enriched for insulin expressing cells while simultaneous depleting proliferative progenitors. Thawed sBC display enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin release compared to controls in vitro and can effectively engraft and function in vivo. Collectively, this approach alleviates current challenges with inefficient and variable sBC generation while improving their functional state. We anticipate that these findings can inform ongoing clinical application of sBC for the treatment of patients with T1D and serve as an important resource for the wider diabetes field that will allow for accelerated research discoveries.","EGFR aberrations are reported in a subset of myofibroblastic lesions with kinase domain duplication (EGFR-KDD) and exon 20 mutations being assigned to infantile fibrosarcomas (IFS), mesoblastic nephroma and fibrous hamartoma of infancy (FHI), respectively. In this retrospective study, we correlated molecular findings with histomorphology of 14 myofibroblastic lesions harboring such genetic changes identified by NGS. We additionally performed DNA methylation profiling (DNAmp) and immunohistochemistry. Lesions were from 10 males and 4 females with a mean age of 3 years (range, 0.3 -14) and occurred subcutaneously in the upper limbs (n = 5), lower limbs (n = 3), back/thorax (n = 5), and the nasal cavity (n = 1). Eleven were cured by surgery, including one relapsed case. Two patients were lost to follow-up. One case was very recent, and the patient was biopsied. Histologically, the lesions showed a wide spectrum varying from classic FHI (n=9) to IFS (n=1) or lipofibromatosis-like tumors (LFT) (n=2) or dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-like (DFSP) (n=1) to a predominantly-myxoid spindle cell lesion (n=1). Immunohistochemically, all neoplasms stained with CD34, while S100 was positive in 2/14. EGFR expression was observed in 9/10 cases. Molecularly, the IFS and one LFT harbored EGFR-KDD, while an exon 20 mutation was identified in all FHI, one LFT and in the DFSP and predominantly myxoid spindle cell lesion. By DNAmp, all but two cases formed a well-defined cluster, demonstrating that these lesions are also epigenetically related. In conclusion, EGFR kinase domain aberrations found in FHI, IFS, LFN, DFSP and a spindle cell lesion with a predominant myxoid stroma of children and adolescents show that these neoplasms with a broad morphological spectrum belong to the group of protein kinase-related lesions with a distinct epigenetic signature. Molecular analyses, including DNAmp, help to identify and characterize this emerging category and become mandatory when targeted treatment is considered.","All cancer cells reprogram metabolism to support aberrant growth. Here, we report that cancer cells employ and depend on imbalanced and dynamic heme metabolic pathways, to accumulate heme intermediates, i.e., porphyrins. We coined this essential metabolic rewiring ‘porphyrin overdrive’ and determined that it is cancer-essential and cancer-specific. Among the major drivers are genes encoding mid-step enzymes governing the production of heme intermediates. CRISPR/Cas9 editing to engineer leukemia cell lines with impaired heme biosynthetic steps confirmed our whole genomic data analyses that porphyrin overdrive is linked to oncogenic states and cellular differentiation. While porphyrin overdrive is absent in differentiated cells or somatic stem cells, it is present in patient-derived tumor progenitor cells, demonstrated by single cell RNAseq, and in early embryogenesis. In conclusion, we identified a dependence of cancer cells on non-homeostatic heme metabolism, and we targeted this cancer metabolic vulnerability with a novel “bait-and-kill” strategy to eradicate malignant cells.","In vitro models of pediatric brain tumors (pBT) are tools instrumental for better understanding the mechanisms contributing to oncogenesis and testing new therapies; and thus, ideally, they should recapitulate the original tumor. We applied  DNA methylation (DNAm) and copy number variation (CNV) profiling to characterize 241 pBT samples, including 155 tumors and 86 pBT-derived cell cultures, and considering serum vs serum-free conditions, late vs early passages, and dimensionality (2D vs 3D cultures). We performed a t-SNE classification and identified differentially methylated regions in tumors compared to cell models.    Early cell cultures recapitulate the original tumor, but serum media and 2D culturing were demonstrated to significant contribute to the divergence of DNAm profiles from the parental ones. All divergent cells clustered together acquiring a common deregulated epigenetic signature, suggesting a shared selective pressure.   In conclusion, DNAm and CNV are informative tools that should be used to assess the recapitulation of pBT-cells from parental tumors.","We isolated CD14+CD45+ dMΦ from the normal or RSA decidua by flow cytometry, followed by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In total, 23,062 single-cell transcriptomes of macrophage were profiled (12,470 Normal and 10,592 RSA), which were divided into 13 major clusters via T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization.","miR-Blood is a high-quality, small RNA expression atlas for the major components of human peripheral blood (plasma, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, natural killer cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells).  *** The data provided in this GEO dataset is licensed under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). *** ","To investigate the role of LRPPRC and mutant LRPPRC on the stability of the mitochondrially encoded mRNA transcripts.","The distribution of RNA in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and the function of RNA localization in maintaining hESC pluripotency and differentiation are currently unknown. Here, by isolating five subcellular components of hESCs and differentiated cells, we uncovered the global subcellular RNA localization in hESC. For protein-coding mRNA, different transcripts of the same gene exhibit an “isoform switch” between subcellular components, which is regulated by localization cis-elements in their variable regions. For noncoding RNA, multiple sequence features such as polyA tail, length, and GC content jointly regulate their subcellular localization. In addition, we found that some developmental genes can be transcribed in advance and confined to chromatin in undifferentiated hESCs. Finally, we revealed significant changes in overall RNA distribution, mapped RNA dynamic localization atlas, and characterized different dynamic RNA localization patterns during hESC differentiation into mesoderm. The multiple RNA localization patterns we revealed will provide some new enlightenment for hESC stemness maintenance and differentiation.","Glucose hypometabolism is one of the major characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The energy deficiency in AD brain has been at least partially attributed to accelerated mitochondrial dysfunction than normal aging. In earlier publications, we have shown that small molecule mitochondrial complex I inhibitor CP2 facilitated mitochondrial regeneration and rescued mitochondrial deficiency in familial AD mice model APP-PS1. Here in this study, we investigated whether a typical mitochondrial deficiency mouse model could recapitulate molecular expression signatures of AD brain and whether CP2 was able to rescue the AD brain phenotype. Ndufs4 is one of the regulatory subunits of mitochondria complex I. Knockout of Ndufs4 resulted in complex I assembly failure and approximately half mitochondrial function loss. Ndufs4-knockout mice are viable but are short in lifespan (up to about 90 days). This model has been previously used to study Leigh syndrome, a heritable mitochondrial deficiency disease. In this dataset, we performed RNAseq on brains of CP2 treated Ndufs4-knockout mice and examined the expression changes upon CP2 treatment.","We performed scRNA-seq analyses to determine the transcriptional landscape of the TAK-931-induced aneuploid cells at the single-cell levels. HeLa cells were treated with DMSO or TAK-931 (300 nM) for 72 h. In the t-SNE plots, the DMSO- and TAK-931-treated cells were classified in two distinct clusters. Indicating that the major population of the TAK-931-treated aneuploid HeLa cells was transformed to a cell contexture that was transcriptionally distinct from that of DMSO-treated control cells. The hallmark of an inflammatory response was remarkably enriched in the TAK-931 treatment cluster. In addition, the positive cells of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine-related genes, such as CXCL8, IL1B, TNHSF14 and TNFRSF1B, were significantly accumulated in the TAK-931-treatment cluster.","To understand the molecular determinants of B12(VHH)-CAR-T polyfunctionality, we simultaneously measured the protein and RNA expression levels of 95 single CD4+ B12(VHH)-CAR-T cells isolated from IMR5 tumor-bearing mouse and re-stimulated with IMR5 tumor cells in vitro. We identified two CAR-T clusters, low polyfunctionality and high polyfunctionality subsets, in a 2D t-SNE plot. Moreover, our single-cell mRNA expression profiling revealed 32 genes that displayed statistically significant, concordant differences between the two cell subsets.","A constant communication between mitochondria and nucleus ensures cellular homeostasis and adaptation to mitochondrial stress. Anterograde regulatory pathways involving a large number of nuclear-encoded proteins control mitochondrial biogenesis and functions. Such functions are deregulated in cancer, resulting in proliferative advantages for cancer cells, aggressive disease and therapeutic resistance. Transcriptional networks controlling the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are known, however alternative splicing (AS) regulation has not been implicated in this communication. Here, we show that IQGAP1, a scaffold protein that regulates AS of distinct gene subsets in gastric cancer cells, participates in AS regulation that strongly affects mitochondrial respiration. Combined proteomic and RNA-seq analyses of IQGAP1KO and parental cells show that IQGAP1KO alters a specific AS event of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (CI) subunit NDUFS4 and downregulates a subset of CI subunits. In IQGAP1KO cells, CI intermediates accumulate resembling assembly deficiencies observed in patients with Leigh syndrome bearing NDUFS4 mutations. Mitochondrial CI activity is significantly lower in KO compared to parental cells, while exogenous expression of IQGAP1 reverses mitochondrial defects of IQGAP1KO cells. Our work sheds light to a novel facet of IQGAP1 in mitochondrial quality control that involves fine-tuning of CI activity through AS regulation in gastric cancer.","We developed a genetic mouse model of chronic necroptosis activation in hepatocytes (in the presence of basal NF-kB activity) that lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. Blocking Necroptosis (RIP3) or NF-kB-(IKKβ) activation in those mice blocked hepatocarcinogenesis.","To understand the molecular determinants of CAR-T cell polyfunctionality, we simultaneously measured the protein and RNA expression levels of 23 single CD8+ D4-IgG4H-CD28TM CAR T cells targeting GPC1 stimulated with T3M4 pancreatic cancer cells. We identified two CAR-T clusters, low polyfunctionality and high polyfunctionality subsets, in a 2D t-SNE plot. Moreover, our single-cell mRNA expression profiling revealed 23 genes that displayed statistically significant, concordant differences between the two cell subsets.","Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and t-SNE analysis indicated that 36/40 ANF cluster separately from MPNST and instead close to the benign tumor entities. Of these 36 tumors, 23 ANF formed a molecularly distinct cluster in proximity to schwannomas. Tumors from this cluster had frequent heterozygous or homozygous loss of CDKN2A/B and significantly more lymphocyte infiltration than MPNST, schwannomas, and NF. Few ANF clustered closely with neurofibromas, schwannomas, or MPNST, raising the question, whether diagnosis based on histological features alone might pose a risk to both over- and underestimate the aggressiveness of these lesions.  ","We performed scRNA-seq to Chinese Spring (CS) cultiva of wheat, and captured 13,063 wheat (CS) root cells with 2523 mean UMIs, 43 417 mean reads and 1851 median genes per cell. One cell type was formed by clustered cells showing similar gene expression profiles. The dimensionality reduction algorithms used in this study are PCA (Principal Components Analysis) and t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding). Results of dimensionality reduction based on PCA are visualized by t-SNE for clustering, and the clustering algorithm adopts SNN to obtain the optimal cell clusters.Finally, we obtained 16 clusters.","Pyruvate metabolism defects lead to severe neuropathies such as the Leigh syndrome (LS) but the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death remain poorly understood. Here, we unravel a connection between pyruvate metabolism and the regulation of the epitranscriptome that is relevant to LS pathogenesis. We identified the transcription factor E4F1 as a key coordinator of AcetylCoenzyme A (AcCoA) production by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and its utilization as an essential co-factor by the Elongator complex to acetylate tRNAs at the wobble position uridine 34 (U34). E4F1-mediated direct transcriptional regulation of Dlat and Elp3, two genes encoding key subunits of the PDC and of the Elongator complex, respectively, ensured proper translation fidelity and cell survival in the central nervous system (CNS) during mouse embryonic development. Furthermore, analysis of PDH-deficient cells highlighted a crosstalk linking the PDC to ELP3 expression that is perturbed in LS patients.","Spinal meningiomas account for 1.2-12% of all meningiomas and 25-45% of all spinal tumours. About 20% of intracranial, but also 4.6% of spinal meningiomas recur and require additional treatment. The classification of intracranial meningiomas has evolved considerably in recent years and uses genetic [1,2,4] as well as epigenetic parameters [3,5] in order to more precisely predict the patients’ prognosis and to lay the ground for therapeutic regiments that are adapted to the aggressiveness of a patient’s tumor. On the other hand, spinal meningiomas are missing in many of the large cohorts that were gathered for the molecular profiling of meningiomas. Also, they have never been thoroughly analyzed separately, and their classification still relies on histopathological findings solely.  We analysed 65 tumour samples from 63 patients, who had histologically proven spinal meningioma to perform genetic and epigenetic profiling. Clinical features are described in Supplementary Table 1, online resource. T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation data shows that most spinal meningiomas separate from cranial meningiomas (Fig. 1A&amp;B) and form two distinct clusters.","Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is often caused by an adenine to guanine variant at m.3243 (m.3243A&gt;G) of the MT-TL1 gene. To understand how this pathogenic variant affects the nervous system, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into excitatory neurons with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function from MELAS patients with the m.3243A&gt;G pathogenic variant. We combined micro-electrode array (MEA) measurements with RNA sequencing (MEA-seq) and found reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and presynaptic function, as well as non-cell autonomous processes in co-cultured astrocytes. Finally, we show that the clinical phase II drug sonlicromanol can improve neuronal network activity when treatment is initiated early in development. This was intricately linked with changes in the neuronal transcriptome. Overall, we provide insight in transcriptomic changes in iPSC-derived neurons with high m.3243A&gt;G heteroplasmy, and show the pathology is partially reversible by sonlicromanol.","We obtained three independent sets of endothelial cells differentiated from iPSCs derived from a Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) patient as well as iPSCs that has been corrected for the mitochondrial mutation.","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 3243A&gt;G tRNALeu(UUR) heteroplasmic mutation (m.3243A&gt;G) exhibits clinically heterogeneous phenotypes. While the high mtDNA heteroplasmy exceeding a critical threshold causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis with stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, the low mtDNA heteroplasmy causes maternally inherited diabetes with or without deafness (MIDD) syndrome. How quantitative differences in mtDNA heteroplasmy produces distinct pathological states has remained elusive. Here we show that despite striking similarities in the energy metabolic gene expression signature, the mitochondrial bioenergetics, biogenesis and fuel catabolic functions are distinct in cells harboring low or high levels of the m.3243A&gt;G mutation compared to wild type cells. We further demonstrate that the low heteroplasmic mutant cells exhibit a coordinate induction of transcriptional regulators of the mitochondrial biogenesis, glucose and fatty acid metabolism pathways that lack in near homoplasmic mutant cells compared to wild type cells. Altogether, these results shed new biological insights on the potential mechanisms by which low mtDNA heteroplasmy may progressively cause diabetes mellitus.","We investigate the participation of miRNAs in the cell response to the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with m.3243A&gt;G mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is the most common cause of MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) syndrome.Through small-RNA sequencing and in silico analysis, we identified 246 differentially-expressed in a transmitochondrial cybrid model of MELAS (100% m.3243A&gt;G mutant mitochondrial DNA), with 126 being up-regulated and 120 down-regulated. The enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms revealed that target genes for dysregulated miRNAs were involved in muscle and nervous system development, heart development, and signaling pathways controlling cardiac events.These data suggest that the miRNA program triggered by the MELAS m.3243A&gt;G mutation could explain for some of the clinical manifestations of the MELAS syndrome.","The expression of mitochondrially-encoded genes requires the efficient processing of long precursor RNAs at the 5´ and 3´ ends of tRNAs, a process which, when disrupted, results in disease. Two such mutations reside within mt-tRNALeu(UUR); a m.3243A&gt;G transition, which is the most common cause of MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes), and m.3302A&gt;G which often causes mitochondrial myopathy (MM). We used parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) that captures the 5´ terminal end of 5´-monophosphorylated mitochondrial RNAs to compare the effects of the m.3243A&gt;G and m.3302A&gt;G mutations on mitochondrial tRNA processing. We confirmed previously identified RNA processing defects, identified common internal cleavage sites and new sites unique to the m.3243A&gt;G mutants that do not correspond to transcript ends. These sites occur in regions of predicted RNA secondary structure, or are in close proximity to such regions, and may identify regions of importance to the processing of mtRNAs.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","To elucidate the regulating networks of dysregulated ncRNAs in Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with m.A3243G mutation.","To elucidate the regulating networks of dysregulated ncRNAs in Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with m.A3243G mutation.","Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html  June 03, 2009: annotation table updated with netaffx build 28 June 07, 2012: annotation table updated with netaffx build 32 June 23, 2016: annotation table updated with netaffx build 35 Protocol: see manufacturer's web site  All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 are included on the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.

Patients with MPS VII exhibit progressive skeletal deformity including kyphoscoliosis and joint dysplasia, which decrease quality of life and increase mortality. Previously, using the naturally-occurring canine model, we demonstrated that one of the earliest skeletal abnormalities to manifest in MPS VII is failed initiation of secondary ossification in vertebrae and long bones at the requisite postnatal developmental stage. The objective of this study was to obtain global insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this failed initiation of secondary ossification using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Epiphyseal tissue was isolated from the vertebrae of control and MPS VII affected dogs at 9 and 14 days-of-age (n=5 for each group). Differences in global gene expression across this developmental window for both cohorts were established using RNA-Seq. A targeted analysis focused on signaling pathways important in the regulation of endochondral ossification, and a subset of gene expression changes were validated using qPCR. Principal Component Analysis revealed clustering of samples from each group, indicating clear effects of both age and disease state. At 9 days-of-age, 1375 genes were significantly differentially expression between MPS VII and control, and by 14 days-of-age, this increased to 4719 genes. Osteoactivin (GPNMB) was the top upregulated gene in MPS VII at both ages. Targeted analysis revealed temporal changes in gene expression from 9 to 14 days-of-age in control samples consistent with chondrocyte maturation, cartilage resorption, and osteogenesis. In MPS VII samples, however, elements of key osteogenic pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and BMP signaling were dysregulated. In conclusion, this study represents the first step towards identifying druggable therapeutic targets and putative biomarkers for bone disease in MPS VII patients during postnatal growth.","We used microarray to detect pathway differences in the hippocampus in mucopolysaccharidosis type VII ( MPS VII ), a mouse model of a lysosomal storage disease Pathway changes were similar to those found in different strain where MPS VII mutation was backcrossed on a C3h-heouj background and implicated immune, vesicle and other pathways","Bone remodeling is characterized by the sequential, local tethering of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and is key to the maintenance of bone integrity.  While bone matrix-mobilized growth factors, such as TGF-β, are proposed to regulate remodeling, no in vivo evidence exists that an osteoclast-produced molecule is the enigmatic coupling factor.  We have identified Cthrc1, a protein secreted by mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts, that targets stromal cells so as to stimulate osteogenesis.  The expression of Cthrc1 is robustly induced when mature osteoclasts are placed on dentin or hydroxyapatite, and also by increasing extracellular calcium.  Cthrc1 expression in bone increases in a high turnover state, such as that which is induced by RANKL injections in vivo, whereas it decreases with aging or following alendronate treatment, conditions associated with suppressed bone turnover.  The targeted deletion of the Cthrc1 gene eliminates Cthrc1 expression in bone, whereas its deficiency in osteoblasts does not exert any significant effect.  Osteoclast-specific deletion of the Cthrc1 gene results in osteopenia due to reduced bone formation: it also impairs the coupling process following resorption induced by RANKL injections, with a resultant impairment of bone mass recovery.  Thus, Cthrc1 is an osteoclast-secreted “coupling factor” that regulates bone remodeling and hence, skeletal integrity.","We used microarray to detect pathway differences in the various brain regions in a monogenic in mucopolysaccharidosis type VII ( MPS VII ), a mouse model of a lysosomal storage disease A number of changes revealed unexpected system and process alterations, such as upregulation of the immune system with few inflammatory changes (a significant difference from the closely related MPS IIIb model), down-regulation of major oligodendrocyte genes even though white matter changes are not a feature histopathologically, and a plethora of developmental gene changes.","Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) is due to mutations within the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase, and results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.  MPS VII causes aortic dilatation and elastin fragmentation. In this study we performed microarray analysis of ascending aortas from normal and MPS VII mice, trying to find out possible genes responsible for the phenotype observed. In addition, during our breeding strategy, we noticed that some MPS VII mice had less dilated aortas, and we proposed that an yet-unidentified gene could be responsible for the difference observed. We therefore included in the analysis two MPS VII mice with aortas that were not dilated.","mature resorbing osteoclasts on dentin","mature osteoclasts on plate","pre-osteoclasts","Mouse bone marrow macrophage","Defining the molecular consequences of lysosomal dysfunction in neuronal cell types remains an area of investigation that is needed to understand many underappreciated phenotypes associated with lysosomal disorders.  Here we characterize GNPTAB-knockout DAOY medulloblastoma cells using different genetic and proteomic approaches, with a focus on how altered gene expression and cell surface abundance of glycoproteins may explain emerging neurological issues in individual with mucolipidosis (ML). The two knockout clones that were characterized demonstrated all the biochemical hallmarks of this disease, including loss of intracellular glycosidase activity due to impaired mannose 6-phosphate-dependent lysosomal sorting, lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, and increased markers of autophagic dysfunction.  RNA sequencing identified altered transcript abundance of several neuronal markers and genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, and neurodegeneration-related pathways.  Using selective exo-enzymatic labeling (SEEL) coupled with proteomics to profile cell surface glycoproteins, we demonstrated altered abundance of several glycoproteins in the knockout cells.  Most striking was increased abundance of the amyloid precursor protein and apolipoprotein B, indicating that loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase function in these cells corresponds with elevation in proteins associated with neurodegeneration.  The implication of these findings on lysosomal disease pathogenesis and the emerging neurological manifestations of GNPTAB-related disorders is discussed","Nonsense mutations, responsible for ~11% of genetic diseases, create premature stop codons (PTCs) and lead to truncated and often non-functional proteins. Recently, programmable RNA pseudouridylation has emerged as a new type of RNA base editor to suppress PTCs. However, current methods suffer from low efficiency and limited precision. Here, we develop RESTART v3, an updated version of RESTART, which utilizes near-cognate tRNAs to improve the readthrough efficiency of pseudouridine-modified PTCs. We show an average of ~5-fold higher editing efficiency than RESTART v2 in cultured cells, currently the most active RNA pseudouridylation tool to mediate PTC readthrough. Moreover, RESTART v3 achieves functional PTC readthrough in disease cell models of cystic fibrosis and Hurler syndrome. Furthermore, RESTART v3 enables accurate incorporation of the original amino acid for nearly half of the PTC sites, considering the naturally occurring frequencies of sense to nonsense codons. In line with the benign off-target effect of RESTART, RESTART v3 does not change the coding information nor the expression level of transcripts with off-target editing; except for the specifically overexpressed tRNA molecule, it does not alter the expression level of endogenous tRNA pool. Overall, RESTART v3 represents an enhanced RNA base editor with increased efficiency and accuracy.","Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder. Subtypes of MPS III are caused by deficiencies in one of four enzymes required for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). An inability to degrade HS leads to progressive neurodegeneration and death in the second or third decades of life. Knowledge of MPS III pathogenesis is incomplete, and no effective therapies exist. We generated the hypomorphic mutations sgshS387Lfs, nagluA603Efs and hgsnatG577Sfsin the endogenous zebrafish genes orthologous to human SGSH, NAGLU, and HGSNAT that are loci for mutations causing MPS III subtypes MPS IIIA, B and C respectively. Our models display the primary MPS III disease signature of significant brain accumulation of HS, while behavioural analyses support hyperactivity phenotypes. Brain transcriptome analysis revealed changes related to lysosomal, glycosaminoglycan, immune system and iron homeostasis biology in all three models but also distinct differences in brain transcriptome state between models. The transcriptome analysis also indicated marked disturbance of the oligodendrocyte cell state in the brains of MPS IIIA, B and C zebrafish, supporting that effects on this cell type are an early and consistent characteristic of MPS III. Overall, our zebrafish models recapture key characteristics of the human disease and phenotypes seen in mouse models. Our models will allow exploitation of the zebrafish’s extreme fecundity and accessible anatomy to dissect the pathological mechanisms both common and divergent between the MPS IIIA, B, and C subtypes.","Neural cells are under immense pressure to maintain proper degradation of molecules using their endo-lysosomal pathway (ELP). In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the gradual cognitive worsening of this age-related disorder is partially due to dysfunction of the ELP. However, AD is a complex disorder and how the genetic landscape eventually leads to AD is unclear. Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia (mucopolysaccharidosis type III, MPSIII) is an extreme consequence of ELP dysfunction, where inherited recessive mutations result in the inability to properly catabolise a particular polysaccharide, which ultimately accumulates and interferes with the function of the ELP. Unlike AD, Sanfilippo is genetically simple (all causative genes are identified). The primary biochemical consequences are understood and animal models of Sanfilippo are considered excellent models of the human disease. Since Sanfilippo and AD show similar pathological changes, they likely share disease-associated mechanisms. Here, we dissect the similarity between AD and Sanfilippo using RNA-seq. We have generated zebrafish knock-in models of both diseases: the early-onset familial AD-like (EOfAD-like) mutation psen1 Q96_K97del  and the MPSIII-like mutation naglu A603fs. We generated a family of zebrafish containing wild type, heterozygous EOfAD-like and homozygous MPSIII-like genotypes. We raised the family until 7 days post fertilisation and performed mRNA-seq on n = 8 induvial larvae per genotype. A power calculation revealed that this experiment was only contained ~50% power to detect differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless, changes to the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in lysosomal function could be detected in the MPS-III mutant larvae, suggesting a homeostatic response as the cells which make up the larval RNA-seq samples respond to dysfunctional lysosomes.","Flavonoids are biological compounds with high potency to modulate molecular processes. The study was designed to estimate genistein, kaempferoland their mixture impact on global gene expression, with special focus on key processes in MPS pathogenesis. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying flavonoid treatment and identified distinct classes of regulated genes during this process.","Association between the microbiome, IBD and liver diseases are known, yet cause and effect  remain elusive. By connecting human microphysiological systems of the gut, liver and circulating  Treg/Th17 cells, we modeled progression of ulcerative colitis (UC) ex vivo. We show that  microbiome-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) may either improve or worsen disease  severity, depending on the activation state of CD4 T cells. Employing a multiomic approach, we  found SCFA reduced innate activation of the UC gut and increased hepatic metabolism. However,  during acute T cell-mediated inflammation, SCFA exacerbate CD4 T cell effector function leading  to gut barrier disruption and liver damage. These paradoxical findings underscore the emerging  utility of human physiomimetic technology in combination with systems immunology to study  causality and temporal facets of gut-liver axis related diseases where animal models might leave  ambiguity.","We obtained accesses to brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the only available post- mortem mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) patient which became available only recently. We performed mass spectrometry (MS)- based proteomics. Our data demonstrate that pathological players detected in Mcoln1-/- mice are also relevant in the human disease. Moreover, we suggest some previously un-known pathological players. We complement this study by using Mcoln1-/- mice, and were able to confirm that many pathological pathways are evident early in disease development, emphasizing the need for early therapeutic intervention.","Mucolipidosis type III is a rare disease caused by mutations in the GNPTG gene, encoding the gamma-subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. Since osteoarthritis and joint stiffness are typical symptoms of the disease, we aimed to investigate the role of the gamma-subunit on cartilage homeostasis. We used microarray analysis to compare the global gene expression in the articular cartilage of Gnptg-KO and wild-type mice.","The enzyme transport vehicle (ETV:IDS) is a lysosomal enzyme fused to iduronate 2-sulfatase (ETV:IDS), the lysosomal enzyme deficient in mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II). ETV:IDS treatment significantly improved brain delivery of IDS in a preclinical model of disease, enabling enhanced distribution to neurons, astrocytes, and microglia throughout the brain. Improved brain exposure for ETV:IDS translated to a significant reduction in accumulated substrates in these CNS cell types and peripheral tissues, and in a complete correction of downstream disease-relevant pathologies in the brain, including secondary accumulation of lysosomal lipids, perturbed gene expression, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of the ETV approach as a new treatment paradigm for MPS II and for other CNS diseases more broadly.","Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VII is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficient activity of β-glucuronidase, leading to progressive accumulation of incompletely degraded heparan, dermatan and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

Although an enzyme replacement therapy is available, the efficacy for the treatment of neuropathic symptoms is limited. To facilitate drug discovery and model disease pathophysiology, we have generated neural stem cells (NSCs) from MPS I patient-derived iPSCs. NSCs exhibited characteristic disease phenotypes with deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and enlargement of lysosomes, correlating with the severity of clinical symptoms. Transcriptome profiling of NSCs revealed differential expression of 429 genes that changed more extensively in the more severe Hurler syndrome subgroup compared to the Hurler-Scheie (median severe) and Scheie (less severe) subgroups. Clustering and pathway analyses demonstrated high concordance of the severity of neurological defects with marked dysregulation of GAG biosynthesis and degradation, lysosomal function and extracellular matrix. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis identified a dramatic upregulation of autophagy pathway, especially in the Hurler syndrome. Thus, GAG accumulation in the patient cells disrupts lysosomal homeostasis affecting multiple related cellular pathways which compensates for IDUA deficiency. These dysregulated process likely lead to enhanced autophagy and more severe disease states. Our studies provide useful tools for clinical biomarker development and potential targets for drug development.","We used microarray to detect pathway differences in the hippocampus in mucopolysaccharidosis type VII ( MPS VII ), a mouse model of a lysosomal storage disease Pathway changes were similar to those found in different strain where MPS VII mutation was backcrossed on a C3h-heouj background and implicated immune, vesicle and other pathways","Establishment of a transcriptomic profile of human cells treated with genistein with particular emphasis on signature of genes coding for enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis stands for the present study.

Results provide important information concerning the extent of action of indomethacin and nimesulide at the molecular level in terms of modulation of gene expression by these substances.","Mucolipidosis type II (MLII) is a severe inherited multisystemic disorder caused by mutations in the GNPTAB gene.

Here we investigate the gene expression in a knock-in mouse model for mucolipidosis type II, generated by the insertion of a cytosine in the murine Gnptab gene (c.3082insC) that is homologous to a homozygous mutation in an MLII patient. Since osteoblasts are critically involved in regulating bone development and remodeling, a genome-wide expression analysis was performed  with RNA isolated from primary cultures of osteoblasts originating from MLII knock-in mice (KI) compared to RNA from wild-type (WT) osteoblasts to identify dysregulated genes involved in pathogenic mechanisms.","Establishment of a transcriptomic profile of human cells treated with kaemferol, daidzein, kaemferol/genistein, or daidzein/genistein with particular emphasis on signature of genes coding for enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis stands for the present study.

MPSIIIB-associated cell defects were prominent in NAGLU-depleted cells. We explored alterations of metabolic pathways in NAGLU-depleted cells versus non-depleted control cells by performing gene expression profiling. Exon array transcriptome analysis showed 96 transcripts with increased expression level and 38 transcripts with decreased expression level in NAGLU-depleted versus non-depleted cells.","Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) is due to mutations within the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase, and results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.

Although many studies have elucidated the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epigenetic regulatory mechanism from NAFL to NASH remains incompletely understood. The histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, MLL4 (also called KMT2D), is a critical epigenetic transcriptional coactivator that mediates overnutrition-induced steatosis in mice, but its potential role in the progression of NASH remains largely unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking the one allele of the Mll4 gene are resistant to hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH conditions compared to wild-type controls. Transcriptome analysis of the livers of control and Mll4+/- mice identified pro-inflammatory genes regulated by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway as major target genes of MLL4. We show that MLL4 binds to p65 and that MLL4 is required for NF-κB transactivation. Myeloid-specific Mll4 knockout mice showed an almost complete block of NASH, while hepatocyte-specific Mll4 knockout mice showed mild inhibition of steatosis. Pro-inflammatory M1 polarization is decreased and anti-inflammatory M2 polarization is increased in liver macrophages from myeloid-specific Mll4 knockout mice. Importantly, we show that histone H3-lysine 4 methylation mediated by the MLL4-complex plays a critical role in promoting the expression of Ccl2 in hepatocytes and M1 marker genes in macrophages. Our results demonstrate that MLL4, through the NF-κB-MLL4 regulatory axis, exacerbates steatohepatitis in the context of an inflammatory response and represents a potential therapeutic target for NASH.","Defining the molecular consequences of lysosomal dysfunction in neuronal cell types remains an area of investigation that is needed to understand many underappreciated phenotypes associated with lysosomal disorders.

Most striking was increased abundance of the amyloid precursor protein and apolipoprotein B, indicating that loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase function in these cells corresponds with elevation in proteins associated with neurodegeneration.  The implication of these findings on lysosomal disease pathogenesis and the emerging neurological manifestations of GNPTAB-related disorders is discussed","Activation of the maternal immune system during pregnancy affects fetal development, which can increase in postnatal susceptibility to a range of diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric disorders. During maternal immune activation (MIA), the maternal body must balance its ressources between mounting an immune response and investing resources into continued metabolism and growth, essentials for survival of the fetus and a successful pregnancy. How the placenta responds to MIA over time and how it can protect the fetus is not well understood, and neither are the fetal consequences of MIA. Here, we characterised the response to acute maternal lung inflammation across time in maternal and fetal organs, using a combination of omics, imaging and integrative computational analyses. We found that the placenta, unlike other maternal organs, did not react by a typical innate immune response, but instead induced genes associated with increased tissue integrity,  likely to prevent fetal exposure to potential infections, and simultaneously reduced expression of growth-associated genes. Subsequently, a return to homeostasis was observed, with heightened expression of biosynthesis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes. These responses likely protect the fetus from inflammation, as we observed no immune response in the fetal liver transcriptome. Instead, we observed metabolic adaptations in the fetus, including a release of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) carrying metabolites, including triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine. Notably, DHA is crucial for fetal brain development. This metabolic response is likely a combination of the placental MIA response and temporary maternal fasting, caused by MIA-induced fever and lack of nutrient intake. Our study shows, for the first time, the integrated temporal and systemic response to LPS in lungs across maternal and fetal organs","The striatum in the brain is involved in various behavioral functions, including reward, and disease processes, such as opioid use disorder (OUD). Further understanding of the role of striatal subregions in reward behaviors and their potential associations with OUD requires molecular identification of specific striatal cell types in human brain. The human striatum contains subregions based on different anatomical, functional, and physiological properties, with the dorsal striatum further divided into caudate and putamen. Both caudate and putamen are associated with alterations in reward processing, formation of habits, and development of negative affect states in OUD. Using single nuclei RNA-sequencing of human postmortem caudate and putamen, we identified canonical neuronal cell types in striatum (e.g., dopamine receptor 1 or 2 expressing neurons, D1 or D2) and less abundant subpopulations, including D1/D2 hybrid neurons and multiple classes of interneurons. By comparing unaffected subjects to subjects with OUD, we found neuronal-specific differences in pathways related to neurodegeneration, interferon response, and DNA damage. DNA damage markers were also elevated in striatal neurons of rhesus macaques following chronic opioid administration. We identified sex-dependent differences in the expression of stress-induced transcripts (e.g., FKBP5) among astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from female subjects with OUD. Thus, we describe striatal cell types and leverage these data to gain insights into molecular alterations in human striatum associated with opioid addiction.","Chronic morphine exposure to rhesus macaque","The aim of this study is to evaluate the presence of intratumoral microbiome in 26 human ACC tissues versus 9 healthy adrenals.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","This study provides transcription, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and enhancer-promoter interactions in HCT116 upon FOXD2 expression. We identified the functional role of FOXD2 by analyzing mutli-omics data.","Comparison of mammosphere-derived epithelial cells across breast cancer susceptible and resistant species","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The coinhibitory PD-1 signalling pathway plays a major role in the context of tumor-specific T cell responses. Conversely, it also contributes to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance as patients receiving anti-PD-1 treatment are prone to developing immune-related adverse events. Yet, the physiological role of the PD-1/PDL-1 axis in T cell homeostasis is still poorly understood. Herein, we show that under steady-state conditions, the absence of PD-1 signaling led to a preferential expansion of CD8+ T cells in the liver. These cells exhibited an oligoclonal TCR repertoire and a terminally differentiated exhaustion profile with high levels of the transcription factors TOX and EOMES. Using loss- or gain-of-function strategies, we could demonstrate that EOMES was required for the clonal expansion and acquisition of this differentiation program. Furthermore, single cell transcriptomics coupled to TCR repertoire analysis strongly supported the notion that these cells arise locally from liver-resident memory CD8 T cells. With these results, we uncovered an unexpected role for PD-1 signaling in liver memory T cell homeostasis.","Comparative transcriptomic analysis of genes regulated by light and conidiation in the wild type and the ∆ve-1 mutant.Identification of light regulated genes during vegetative growth.Identification of DEGs during asexual development","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Recent studies suggested that microglia, the primary brain immune cells, can affect circuit connectivity and neuronal function. Microglia infiltrate the neuroepithelium early in embryonic development and are maintained in the brain throughout adulthood. Several maternal environmental factors, such as aberrant microbiome, immune activation, and poor nutrition, can influence prenatal brain development. Nevertheless, it is unknown how changes in the prenatal environment instruct the developmental trajectory of infiltrating microglia, which in turn affect brain development and function. Here we show that after maternal immune activation (MIA) microglia from the offspring have a long-lived decrease in immune reactivity (blunting) across the developmental trajectory. The blunted immune response was concomitant with changes in the chromatin accessibility and reduced transcription factor occupancy of the open chromatin. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that MIA does not induce a distinct subpopulation but rather decreases the contribution to inflammatory microglia states. Prenatal replacement of MIA microglia with physiological infiltration of naïve microglia ameliorated the immune blunting and restored a decrease in presynaptic vesicle release probability onto dopamine receptor type-two medium spiny neurons, indicating that aberrantly formed microglia due to an adverse prenatal environment impacts the long-term microglia reactivity and proper striatal circuit development.","Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), which is caused by mutations in the gene encoding WASP, manifests in a wide range of hematologic and immune dysfunctions and predisposition to cancer development 1. WASP is most known as a cytoplasmic effector of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. However, defective actin polymerization cannot explain many aspects of WAS pathogenesis. Incomplete knowledge of WASP function precludes in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms of WAS, and therefore hampers the development of effective therapies. Here we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from WAS patients (WAS-iPSC) and corresponding isogenic iPSCs wherein the mutations were corrected by targeted genome editing. Hematopoietic cells differentiated from WAS-iPSCs not only recapitulated known disease phenotypes, but also revealed novel nuclear functions of WASP. WASP deficiency causes differential expression of genes involved in many aspects of immune cell function, most prominently cell proliferation. It also leads to a large number of alternative splicing events that are highly enriched in cell cycle regulators. Proteomic analyses revealed that WASP physically interacted with nuclear body components, nuclear structural proteins, chromatin modifying complexes, and many RNA-binding proteins including multiple splicing factors. We show that WASP physically interacts with SRSF2 and is important for nuclear speckle organization. WASP regulates cell cycle progression by physically interacting with EZH2 and thereby influencing epigenetic silencing of its target gene CDKN2A (aka p16). Together, these observations unveil novel functions of WASP in regulation of RNA splicing and cell cycle. The binding of WASP to SRSF2 and EZH2 and the misregulation of these two frequently mutated genes in hematologic malignancies2 in WAS cells provide a possible mechanism for the frequent occurance of malignancy in WAS patients. Furthermore, WAS-associated splicing and proliferation abnormalities could serve as diagnosis tools for patients at risk for cancer and may be exploited as therapeutic targets.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The goals of this study are to corroborate whether Trem2 has a protective role against metabolic dysfunction and progression in a mouse model of NAFLD. We further performed an unbiased transcriptome analysis from the livers of 8-week HFD-fed WT versus Trem2–/– mice. In this screen, a cluster of 104 transcripts were up-regulated and 57 were down-regulated in response to Trem2 deficiency. Among these differentially expressed genes (adjusted P &lt; 0.05), gene sets that contribute to fatty acid metabolic dysfunction, collagen fibril organization and cytokine secretion were significantly enriched in Trem2–/– livers, whereas long-chain/unsaturated fatty acid metabolic process and monocarboxylic acid metabolic process were overrepresented among WT livers.","We obtained accesses to brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the only available post- mortem mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) patient which became available only recently. We performed mass spectrometry (MS)- based proteomics. Our data demonstrate that pathological players detected in Mcoln1-/- mice are also relevant in the human disease. Moreover, we suggest some previously un-known pathological players. We complement this study by using Mcoln1-/- mice, and were able to confirm that many pathological pathways are evident early in disease development, emphasizing the need for early therapeutic intervention.","Mucolipidosis type III is a rare disease caused by mutations in the GNPTG gene, encoding the gamma-subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. Since osteoarthritis and joint stiffness are typical symptoms of the disease, we aimed to investigate the role of the gamma-subunit on cartilage homeostasis. We used microarray analysis to compare the global gene expression in the articular cartilage of Gnptg-KO and wild-type mice.","Cachexia is a wasting syndrome characterized by pronounced skeletal muscle loss.  In cancer, cachexia associates with increased morbidity and mortality and decreased treatment tolerance. Although advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms of cachexia, translating these advances to the clinic has been challenging. One reason for this shortcoming may be the current animal models that fail to fully recapitulate the etiology of human cancer-induced tissue wasting. Because pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) presents with a high incidence of cachexia, we engineered a mouse model of PDA, that we named KPP. KPP mice, similar to PDA patients, progressively lose skeletal and adipose mass as a consequence of their tumors. In addition, KPP muscles exhibit a similar gene ontology to cachectic patients. We envision the KPP model will be a useful resource for advancing our mechanistic understanding and ability to treat cancer cachexia.","Recent studies have unveiled the deep sea as a rich biosphere, populated by species descended from shallow-water ancestors post-mass extinctions. Research on genomic evolution and microbial symbiosis has shed light on how these species thrive in extreme deep-sea conditions. However, early adaptation stages, particularly the roles of conserved genes and symbiotic microbes, remain inadequately understood. This study examined transcriptomic and microbiome changes in shallow-water mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to deep-sea conditions at the Site-F cold seep in the South China Sea. Results reveal complex gene expression adjustments in stress response, immune defense, homeostasis, and energy metabolism pathways during adaptation. After 10 days of deep-sea exposure, shallow-water mussels and their microbial communities closely resembled those of native deep-sea mussels, demonstrating host and microbiome convergence in response to adaptive shifts. Notably, methanotrophic bacteria, key symbionts in native deep-sea mussels, emerged as a dominant group in the exposed mussels. Host genes involved in immune recognition and endocytosis correlated significantly with the abundance of these bacteria. Overall, our analyses provide insights into adaptive transcriptional regulation and microbiome dynamics of mussels in deep-sea environments, highlighting the roles of conserved genes and microbial community shifts in adapting to extreme environments.","We examined how mTORC1 influences mRNA expression and alternative splicing during a growth response in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293E cells, in which mTORC1 is not hyperactive.  We released a starvation-induced growth arrest by refeeding, then analyzed mRNA levels and alternative splicing events one and four hours later under either control or Torin1 treatment conditions.","Defining the molecular consequences of lysosomal dysfunction in neuronal cell types remains an area of investigation that is needed to understand many underappreciated phenotypes associated with lysosomal disorders.  Here we characterize GNPTAB-knockout DAOY medulloblastoma cells using different genetic and proteomic approaches, with a focus on how altered gene expression and cell surface abundance of glycoproteins may explain emerging neurological issues in individual with mucolipidosis (ML). The two knockout clones that were characterized demonstrated all the biochemical hallmarks of this disease, including loss of intracellular glycosidase activity due to impaired mannose 6-phosphate-dependent lysosomal sorting, lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, and increased markers of autophagic dysfunction.  RNA sequencing identified altered transcript abundance of several neuronal markers and genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, and neurodegeneration-related pathways.  Using selective exo-enzymatic labeling (SEEL) coupled with proteomics to profile cell surface glycoproteins, we demonstrated altered abundance of several glycoproteins in the knockout cells.  Most striking was increased abundance of the amyloid precursor protein and apolipoprotein B, indicating that loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase function in these cells corresponds with elevation in proteins associated with neurodegeneration.  The implication of these findings on lysosomal disease pathogenesis and the emerging neurological manifestations of GNPTAB-related disorders is discussed","To investigate the gene expression profile of macrophages in response to Salmonella infection in vitro, we differentiated mouse BMDMs and the cells were used as a model for Salmonella infection We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of BMDMs at two conditions (uninfected and Salmonella-infected cells).","This study aims to investigate genes regulated by liver tissue from the mice treated with water extract of Emilia sonchifolia.","We have found that drug-resistant (DR) Mtb infection alters the host pathogen interactions thought to occur during drug-sensitive (DS) Mtb infection. Recent data suggests that lack of both, Type I and IL-1, signaling pathways leads to susceptibility to infection to DR Mtb infection. To understand the pathways involved in maintaining control of DR Mtb infection, we are sequencing the bulk lung cells early in infection.","PD-1 blockade therapy, harnessing the cytotoxic potential of CD8+  T cells, has yielded clinical success in treating malignancies. However, its efficacy is often limited due to the progressive differentiation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells into a hypofunctional state known as terminal exhaustion. Despite identifying CD8+ T cell subsets associated with immunotherapy resistance, the molecular pathway triggering the resistance remains elusive. Given the clear association of CD38 with CD8+ T cell subsets resistant to anti-PD1 therapy, we investigated its role in inducing resistance. Phenotypic and functional characterization, along with single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of both in vitro chronically stimulated and intratumoral CD8+ T cells, revealed that CD38-expressing CD8+ T cells are terminally exhausted. Exploring the molecular mechanism, we discovered that CD38 expression was crucial in promoting terminal differentiation of CD8+ T cells by suppressing TCF1 expression, thereby rendering them unresponsive to anti-PD1 therapy. Genetic ablation of CD38 in tumor reactive CD8+ T cells restored TCF1 levels and improved the responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy in mice. Mechanistically, CD38 expression on exhausted CD8+ T cells elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels through RyR2 calcium channel activation. This, in turn, promoted chronic AKT activation, leading to TCF1 loss. Knockdown of RyR2 or inhibition of AKT in CD8+ T cells maintained TCF1 levels, induced a sustained anti-tumor response, and enhanced responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy. Thus, targeting CD38 represents a potential strategy to improve the efficacy of anti-PD1 treatment in cancer.","The glymphatic movement of fluid through the brain powerfully clears metabolic waste. We observed multisensory 40 Hz stimulation promotes the influx of cerebrospinal fluid and the efflux of interstitial fluid in the cortex of the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, which was associated with increased aquaporin-4 polarization along astrocytic endfeet, dilated meningeal lymphatic vessels, and amyloid accumulation in cervical lymph nodes. Inhibiting glymphatic clearance abolished the removal of amyloid by multisensory 40 Hz stimulation. Using chemogenetic manipulation and a genetically encoded sensor for neuropeptide signaling, we found VIP+ interneurons facilitate glymphatic clearance by regulating arterial pulsatility. Our findings establish novel mechanisms to recruit the glymphatic system to remove brain amyloid.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Transcriptional lineage factors are a prominent class of essential genes in cancer, but the mechanisms that maintain lineage fidelity in advanced cancer clones, and whether lineage factor pathways could be broadly exploited for cancer therapy remain poorly understood. Here, we have used clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) as a model to characterise the mechanisms that underlie lineage factor dependence in cancer. Through CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screening and functional validation we find that loss of SMARCB1, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, can confer an advantage to ccRCC cells upon inhibition of the essential renal lineage factor PAX8. PAX8 inhibition resistant cells formed tumours with a dramatically altered histology showing neuroendocrine differentiation. Based on ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis, SMARCB1 inactivation leads to large-scale loss of kidney-specific epigenetic programmes, acquisition of a cellular state resembling that of rhabdoid tumours, and eventual activation of proliferative pathways. We show that these pathways are supported by the adoption of new transcriptional dependencies on IRF2, BHLHE40, and ZNFX1, factors that represent rare essential genes across different lineage-specific and oncogenic pathways, a principle validated in a large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screening data set comprising hundreds of cancer cell lines. Thus, lineage factor requirements in cancer can switch upon challenge. The rules governing such lineage switching should be considered when designing novel lineage factor-targeted cancer therapies.","Fish oil or its major constituent, namely omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid (n3-PUFA), are popular diets to improve neurogenesis, neuroprotection, and overall brain functions. A growing number of studies advocate for the balanced dietary supplements of n3- and n6-PUFA to maximize the brain functions. Our objective was to probe the implication of PUFA to ameliorate social stress (SS). Mice were fed a customized n-3 PUFA-enriched diet (ERD, n3:n6= 7:1), a balanced diet (BLD, n3:n6= 1:1) or a standard lab diet (STD, n3:n6= 1:6). Past reports linked these diets to brain transcriptomic regulations; hence, we aimed to investigate the effects of these diets on mice exposed to Aggressor-exposed SS (Agg-E SS) model. Mice randomly encountered life-threatening trauma from conspecific aggressor for 10 consecutive days. Stressed mice on STD showed multiple behavioral deficits that lingered even 6 weeks post-Agg-E SS. In comparison, ERD and BLD elevated bodyweights but potentially triggered behavioral resilience to SS. Comprehensive mapping of the behavioral traits projected a diet-specific variance, which was mirrored by the brain transcriptomic readouts. We focused on those brain transcriptomic networks that were exclusively perturbed by the cumulative effects of Diet, Stress and Time. STD adversely affected the gene networks associated with the cell mortality, energy homeostasis and neurodevelopment disorder; however, BLD showed long-term benefits in regulating these gene networks. Further titration of PUFA supplements in daily diets can reduce the adverse effects caused by unbalanced supplement of PUFA without compromising their health benefits.","We report the differential gene expression patterns of TILs from two patients after treating the cells with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) for 2 or 3 hours. Among the common LPA-regulated genes are transcription factors and other immediate early genes as well as T-cell regulatory cell-surface molecules","Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are gatekeepers of immune homeostasis and characterized by expression of Foxp3, which maintains Treg identity. The transcriptional activator CREB critically stabilizes Foxp3 expression in vitro. Here we demonstrate that in mice with a Foxp3-specific knockout of CREB, Tregs show a reduced Foxp3 expression in vivo, but surprisingly enhanced expression of IL-13, IL-10, ST-2 and CREM. This rendered such Tregs highly suppressive in vitro and prevents disease activity in Th1 models like T cell mediated transfer colitis in an IL-10 dependent way. On the other hand, type 2 B cell responses were enhanced resulting in high IgE levels and susceptibility towards experimental asthma. Our data suggest that CREB expression in Tregs is important for the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses by regulating ST-2 and IL-10.","expression analysis in colon cancer from  Msh2 and Tgfbr2 intestinal epithelium inactivated mouse model detailed gene expression analysis in colon cacer developed in mouse model with  Msh2 and Tgfbr2  inactivated eary n  from Villin Cre recombnase exclusively in the intestine","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease, and its pathogenesis is still being intensively studied to explain the reasons of significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease. To search for possible HCM modifier genes involved in the HCM development we first attempted to analyze gene expression profile coupled with DNA methylation profile in the hypertrophied myocardium of HCM patients; the control group consisted of patients with aortic stenosis. The transcriptome analysis identified significant differences in levels of 193 genes, most of which were underexpressed in HCM. The methylome analysis revealed 1755 nominally significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs), mostly hypomethylated in HCM. The clear differences in DNA methylation profiles between the studied groups indicate the involvement of this process in the formation of primary left ventricle hypertrophy in HCM. Based on gene ontology enrichment analysis, the majority of biological processes, overrepresented by both differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and DMP-containing genes, are involved in the regulation of locomotion and muscle structure development. The intersection of 193 DEGs and 978 DMP-containing genes pinpointed eight genes, expression of which differed between studied groups and correlated with methylation levels of the neighboring DMPs. Half of these genes (AUTS2, GIGYF1, PRRT1, and SLC17A7) were found underexpressed in HCM and involved in neurogenesis and synapse functioning. Our data suggesting the possible involvement of innervation-associated genes in HCM provide additional insights in the disease pathogenesis and expand the field of further research.","The purpose of this study was to understand the response of trabecular meshwork under mechanical stretch using a multi-omics approach.","kRas (KR) tumors grow faster when expressing kRas and HPV E6E7 (KHR).

Nevertheless, limited access to human placenta samples and the paucity of a proper in vitro model system has hampered our understanding of the mechanisms underlying early human placental development and placenta-associated pregnancy complications. To overcome these constraints, we established a simple procedure with a short-term treatment of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) in trophoblast stem cell culture medium (TSCM) to convert human primed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to trophoblast stem-like cells (TSLCs). These TSLCs show not only comparable morphology and gene expression profile to bona fide human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) but also long-term self-renewal capacity with bipotency that allows the cells to differentiate into extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) and syncytiotrophoblasts (ST). These indicate that TSLCs are equivalent to genuine human TSCs. Our data suggest a straightforward approach to make human TSCs directly from pre-existing primed PSCs and provide a valuable opportunity to study human placenta development and pathology even from patients with placenta-related diseases.","In this study, 3,869 donkey skeletal muscle lncRNAs were identified using RNA-Seq along with a stringent screening procedure in the longissimus dorsi (LD) and gluteal (G) muscles. These lncRNAs share many characteristics with other mammalian lncRNAs, such as shorter open reading frames (ORFs) and lower expression levels than mRNAs. Furthermore, in pairwise comparisons between libraries of the same stage for two genetic types of male Dezhou donkey, 73 differentially expressed lncRNAs were common to all muscle tissues.","Niemann-Pick Type C disease (NPC) is a rare fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in NPC1 and NPC2 gene leading to abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in lysosomes. There have been no available treatments and FDA approved drugs for treating NPC. SAHA, a HDAC inhibitor (HDACi), was shown to ameliorate NPC disease phenotypes and considered as a therapeutics candidate but its mechanism of action is not fully clarified yet. Here, we investigated whether SAHA and HNHA, a new derivative of SAHA, reduced cholesterol level and then performed NGS analysis for these two compounds in NPC-iNSCs. Intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport factors were highly enriched by two compounds treatment in NPC-iNSCs. Notably, SNAP25, a subunit of SNARE complex was significantly upregulated. Since autophagic flux is impaired in NPC cells due to SNARE complex deficiency, we hypothesized that increasing SNAP25 could contribute to form autolysosomes. When SNAP25 was overexpressed in NPC cells, it compensated deficient Vamp8-SNAP29-STX17 complexes to Vamp8-SNAP25-STX17 complexes then it restores autolysosomes leading to reduce accumulated LC3, LAMP1a, and p62. Consistently, SNAP25 was upregulated by HDAC inhibitors treatment and recovered deficient autophagic flux in vitro, and in vivo. Therefore, upregulation of SNAP25 by HDAC inhibition ameliorated NPC phenotypic and behavioral disorder in 2D culture system and NPC-/- mouse model. These results demonstrated a key role of SNAP25 to ameliorate NPC disease phenotypes and provided HDAC inhibitors as new therapeutic candidates for NPC treatment","Since its first description in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been the most common type of dementia. Initially thought to be caused by age-associated accumulation of plaques, in recent years, research has increasingly associated AD with lysosomal storage and metabolic disorders, and the explanation of its pathogenesis has shifted from amyloid and tau accumulation to oxidative stress and impaired lipid and glucose metabolism aggravated by hypoxic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms linking those cellular processes and conditions to disease progression have yet to be defined. Here, we applied a disease similarity approach to identify unknown molecular targets of AD by using transcriptomic data from congenital diseases known to increase AD risk, namely Down Syndrome, Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC), and Mucopolysaccharidoses I. We uncovered common pathways, hub genes, and miRNAs across in vitro and in vivo models of these diseases as potential molecular targets for neuroprotection and amelioration of AD pathology, many of which have never been associated with AD. We then investigated common molecular alterations in brain samples from an NPC disease mouse model by juxtaposing them with brain samples of both human and mouse models of AD. Detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses revealed the NPCmut mouse as a novel, short-lived in vivo model of AD characterized by accelerated brain aging, concluding that the NPCmut mouse model can serve as a potential short-lived in vivo model for AD research and for understanding molecular factors affecting brain aging. This research represents the first comprehensive approach to congenital disease association with neurodegeneration and a new perspective on AD research while highlighting shortcomings and lack of correlation in diverse in vitro models. Considering the lack of an AD mouse model that recapitulates the physiological hallmarks of brain aging, the characterization of a short-lived NPC mouse model will further accelerate the research in these fields and offer a unique model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD from a perspective of accelerated brain aging.","We generated hepatic organoids from Nieman Pick Type B patients with the aim to investigate their lipid status.  To discover genes related to lipid metabolism likely involved in lipid deposits.","Cholesterol is required for oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for the intracellular cholesterol transporter NPC1 in these processes. NPC1 functions in late endosomes and lysosomes to efflux unesterified cholesterol, and its deficiency causes Niemann-Pick disease Type C, an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and early death. To identify cell types and pathways affected early in pathogenesis, we performed single nuclear RNA-seq on the forebrain of Npc1-/- mice at P16. This analysis uncovered striking transcriptional changes in the oligodendrocyte lineage during the period of developmental myelination, accompanied by diminished maturation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Unexpectedly, we identified a significant upregulation of genes associated with neurogenesis and synapse formation in Npc1-/- oligodendrocyte lineage cells, reflecting diminished gene silencing by H3K27me3 and H3K9me3.","Cholesterol is required for oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination.

Moreover, sporadic PD patients also have a substantial reduction of GCase activity. Genetic variants of SMPD1 are also overrepresented in PD cohorts, whereas a reduction of its encoded enzyme (acid sphingomyelinase or ASM) activity is linked to an earlier age of PD onset. Despite both converging on the ceramide pathway, how the combined deficiencies of both enzymes might interact to modulate PD has yet to be explored. Therefore, we created a double-knockout (DKO) AQ4 zebrafish line for both gba1 (or gba) ¶ and smpd1 to test for an interaction in vivo, hypothesising an exacerbation of phenotypes in the DKO line compared to those for single mutants","The regenerative capacity of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) differs between species; in bigger mammals such as humans and sheep, CECs are arrested in a non-proliferative state. Damage to these cells can compromise its function leading to corneal opacity and impaired vision. Corneal transplantation is the current treatment for the recovery of a clear eyesight, but the donor tissue demand is higher than the offer and there is the need to develop novel treatment modalities. In contrast, rabbit CECs retain a high proliferative profile and have the capacity to repopulate the endothelium upon injury. There is currently a lack of fundamental knowledge to explain the difference in the proliferation capacity of these cells across species. Gaining information on the transcriptomic differences across species could allow the identification of crucial proliferation drivers of CEC proliferation to develop novel regenerative medicine therapies. In this study we have analyzed at the transcriptomic level corneal endothelial samples originating from human, sheep, and rabbit. To understand the differences across the CECs proliferation capacity in each species, we have generated an automated pipeline for the analysis of pathways with different activity. Our results revealed that 52 pathways had commonly different activity when comparing species with non-proliferative endothelium (human and sheep) to species with proliferative endothelium (rabbit).","We analysed differences in gene expression upon treatment of MSD patient fibroblast lines with either tazarotene or adapalene and DMSO control (untreated condition)","We analysed differences in gene expression upon treatment of MSD patient fibroblast lines and control fibroblast lines with tazarotene and bexarotene or DMSO control (untreated condition)","Niemann-Pick type A disease (NPA) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene coding for the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). ASM deficiency leads to the consequent accumulation of its uncatabolized substrate, the sphingolipid sphingomyelin (SM), causing severe progressive brain disease.   To study the effect of the aberrant lysosomal accumulation of SM on cell homeostasis we loaded skin fibroblasts derived from a NPA patient with exogenous SM to mimic the levels of accumulation characteristic of the pathological neurons. In SM-loaded NPA fibroblasts we found the blockage of the autophagy flux and the impairment of the mitochondrial compartment paralleled by the altered transcription of several genes, mainly belonging to the electron transport chain machinery and to the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. In addition, SM loading induces the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor EB that promotes the lysosomal biogenesis and exocytosis. Interestingly, we obtained similar biochemical findings in the brain of the NPA mouse model lacking ASM (ASMKO mouse) at the neurodegenerative stage. Our work provides a new in vitro model to study NPA etiopathology and suggests the existence of a pathogenic lysosome-plasma membrane axis that with an impairment in the mitochondrial activity is responsible for the cell death.","Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) leads to durable and complete tumour regression in some patients but in others gives temporary, partial or no response. Accordingly, significant efforts are underway to identify tumour-intrinsic mechanisms underlying ICB resistance. Results from a published CRISPR screen in a mouse model suggested that targeting STUB1, an E3 ligase involved in protein homeostasis, may overcome ICB resistance but the molecular basis of this effect remains unclear. Herein, we report an under-appreciated role of STUB1 to dampen the interferon gamma (IFNg) response. Genetic deletion of STUB1 increased IFNGR1 abundance on the cell surface and thus enhanced the downstream IFNg response as showed by multiple approaches including Western blotting, flow cytometry, qPCR, phospho-STAT1 assay, immunopeptidomics, proteomics, and gene expression profiling. Human prostate and breast cancer cells with STUB1 deletion were also susceptible to cytokine-induced growth inhibition. Furthermore, blockade of STUB1 protein function recapitulated the STUB1-null phenotypes. Despite these encouraging in vitro data and positive implications from clinical datasets, we did not observe in vivo benefits of inactivating Stub1 in mouse syngeneic tumour models – with or without combination with anti-PD-1 therapy. However, our findings elucidate STUB1 as a barrier to IFNg sensing, prompting further investigations to assess if broader inactivation of human STUB1 in both tumors and immune cells could overcome ICB resistance.","The aim of the global study was to compare the effects of maternal age and parity on gene expression of equine embryos. For that, 17 embryos were collected at 8 days post ovulation (expanded blastocyst stage) from 3 groups of young or old nulliparous or multiparous mares: 6 from young nulliparous mares (5 or 6 year-old, never foaled before), 5 from young multiparous mares (6 year-old and foaled at least once) and 6 from old multiparous (10-16 year-old and foaled at least once).  Embryos collected were cut in 2 parts: one hemi-embryo containing pure trophoblast and the other one containing trophoblast + inner cell mass. ARN extractions were performed for all samples using PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystem). Five nanograms of both parts of each embryo were sequenced in paired-end with a length of 30-50bp separately using Illumina NextSeq 500 High. Data were trimmed using Cutadapt. Sequences with less than 10bp were removed.   Data for young and old multiparous mares had been already published in [accession: GSE162893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE162893].

Using RNAseq we identified a group of genes that provides novel insight regarding the metabolic pathways and transcriptional regulation, and pathogenic features that were influenced by BCG_2177c gene, a TetR-like repressor, during the lipid metabolism in slow-growing mycobacteria that could be extrapolated to other members of the MTBC.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The aim of the study was to compare the effects of maternal age on embryos in horses.

The developmental events occurring following hatching in ungulates include the proliferation and maturation of extra-embryonic membranes –trophoblast and hypoblast- and the formation of a flat embryonic disc, similar to that found in humans, that initiates gastrulation prior to implantation. Unfortunately, our understanding of these key processes for embryo survival is limited because current culture systems are unable to sustain ungulate embryo development beyond hatching. Herein, we report a culture system that recapitulates most developmental landmarks that characterize ovine development up to gastrulating stages: trophoblast maturation, hypoblast migration, embryonic disc formation, Rauber´s layer removal, epiblast polarization and mesoderm differentiation. In this dataset we compare the transcriptional profile of ovine day (D) 14 in vitro cultured embryos and embryonic day (E) 11 and 12.5 in vivo derived embryos by RNA-seq.","Purpose: Advanced melanoma patients have poor prognosis.

To assess the tropism of the five AAV vectors in the human livers, single-cell suspensions of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) were analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Differentially expressed genes were identified in AAV vector-transduced hepatocytes and unique cell populations.","Niemann-Pick Type C disease (NPC) is a rare fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in NPC1 and NPC2 gene leading to abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in lysosomes. There have been no available treatments and FDA approved drugs for treating NPC. SAHA, a HDAC inhibitor (HDACi), was shown to ameliorate NPC disease phenotypes and considered as a therapeutics candidate but its mechanism of action is not fully clarified yet. Here, we investigated whether SAHA and HNHA, a new derivative of SAHA, reduced cholesterol level and then performed NGS analysis for these two compounds in NPC-iNSCs. Intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport factors were highly enriched by two compounds treatment in NPC-iNSCs. Notably, SNAP25, a subunit of SNARE complex was significantly upregulated. Since autophagic flux is impaired in NPC cells due to SNARE complex deficiency, we hypothesized that increasing SNAP25 could contribute to form autolysosomes. When SNAP25 was overexpressed in NPC cells, it compensated deficient Vamp8-SNAP29-STX17 complexes to Vamp8-SNAP25-STX17 complexes then it restores autolysosomes leading to reduce accumulated LC3, LAMP1a, and p62. Consistently, SNAP25 was upregulated by HDAC inhibitors treatment and recovered deficient autophagic flux in vitro, and in vivo. Therefore, upregulation of SNAP25 by HDAC inhibition ameliorated NPC phenotypic and behavioral disorder in 2D culture system and NPC-/- mouse model. These results demonstrated a key role of SNAP25 to ameliorate NPC disease phenotypes and provided HDAC inhibitors as new therapeutic candidates for NPC treatment","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","In order to identify trasncriptomic changes happening upon the activation of the IFNγ pathway during pluripotency acquisition, female NPCs were induced for reprogramming in the presence or absence of IFNγ for the first five days of the process.

Indeed, mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) or PS2 are a major cause of early onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD). However, PS proteins also exert multiple functions beyond Aβ generation. In this study, we examine the individual roles of PS1 and PS2 in cellular cholesterol metabolism. Deletion of PS1 or PS2 in mouse models led to cholesterol accumulation in cerebral neurons. Cholesterol accumulation was also observed in lysosomes of embryonic fibroblasts from PS1-KO and PS2-KO mice, and associated with decreased expression of the Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein involved in intracellular cholesterol transport at late endosome/lysosome. Mass spectrometry and complementary biochemical methods also revealed abnormal N-glycosylation of NPC1 and several other membrane proteins in PS1-KO and PS2-KO cells. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of N-glycosylation resulted in intracellular cholesterol accumulation prominently in lysosomes as well as decrease of NPC1 expression in wild-type MEFs, thereby resembling the changes in PS1-KO and PS2-KO MEFs. In turn, treatment of PS1-KO and PS2-KO MEFs with a chaperone inducer, Arimoclomol, attenuated decrease of NPC1 and rescued the lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. Additionally, the intracellular cholesterol accumulation in PS1-KO and PS2-KO MEFs was prevented by NPC1 overexpression. Collectively, these data indicate that PS/γ-secretase dysfunction results in an impairment of protein N-glycosylation, which eventually causes NPC1 decrease and intracellular cholesterol accumulation. 3'RNASeq of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with PS1- or PS2-deficiency compared with controls. Biological replicates","Since its first description in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been the most common type of dementia. Initially thought to be caused by age-associated accumulation of plaques, in recent years, research has increasingly associated AD with lysosomal storage and metabolic disorders, and the explanation of its pathogenesis has shifted from amyloid and tau accumulation to oxidative stress and impaired lipid and glucose metabolism aggravated by hypoxic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms linking those cellular processes and conditions to disease progression have yet to be defined. Here, we applied a disease similarity approach to identify unknown molecular targets of AD by using transcriptomic data from congenital diseases known to increase AD risk, namely Down Syndrome, Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC), and Mucopolysaccharidoses I. We uncovered common pathways, hub genes, and miRNAs across in vitro and in vivo models of these diseases as potential molecular targets for neuroprotection and amelioration of AD pathology, many of which have never been associated with AD. We then investigated common molecular alterations in brain samples from an NPC disease mouse model by juxtaposing them with brain samples of both human and mouse models of AD. Detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses revealed the NPCmut mouse as a novel, short-lived in vivo model of AD characterized by accelerated brain aging, concluding that the NPCmut mouse model can serve as a potential short-lived in vivo model for AD research and for understanding molecular factors affecting brain aging. This research represents the first comprehensive approach to congenital disease association with neurodegeneration and a new perspective on AD research while highlighting shortcomings and lack of correlation in diverse in vitro models. Considering the lack of an AD mouse model that recapitulates the physiological hallmarks of brain aging, the characterization of a short-lived NPC mouse model will further accelerate the research in these fields and offer a unique model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD from a perspective of accelerated brain aging.","Sigma-2-ligands (S2L) are characterized by high-affinity interaction with their cognate sigma-2 receptor, overexpressed in rapidly proliferating tumor cells. As such, S2L were developed as imaging probes (ISO1) or as cancer therapeutics, alone (SV119 [C6], SW43 [C10]) and as delivery vehicles for cytotoxic drug cargoes following chemical conjugation (C6-Erastin, C10-SMAC). However, the exact mechanism of S2L-induced cytotoxicity remains to be fully elucidated. A series of high-affinity S2L were evaluated regarding their cytotoxicity profiles across pancreatic, ovarian, and synovial cancer cell lines. While C6 and C10 displayed distinct cytotoxicities (extended aliphatic side chains), C0 (no aliphatic side chain) and ISO1 (structurally unrelated) were essentially non-toxic, enabling us to investigate the unique mechanism of S2L cytotoxicity. Confocal microscopy and lipidomics analysis in cellular and mouse models revealed that C10 induced an increase in intralysosomal free cholesterol, a corresponding increase in cholesterol esters, suggestive of unaltered intracellular cholesterol trafficking and processing, and cytotoxicity due to cholesterol excess, a phenomenon that contrasts the effects of inhibiting NPC1 function. RNA-sequencing revealed that gene clusters involved in cholesterol homeostasis and ER stress response were activated exclusively by cytotoxic S2L. ER stress markers were confirmed on qPCR, and ER stress modulators inhibited or enhanced cytotoxicity of C10 confirming the involvement of ER stress response in the cytotoxicity of S2L. Moreover, C10 increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) which were also confirmed with qPCR and at the protein level and were found to be a pro-survival mechanism activated by ER stress response. Moreover, inhibiting the processes downstream this adaptive response with simvastatin resulted in synergistic treatment outcomes when combined with C10 in vitro and in vivo. Of note, the conjugates retained the S2L-mediated cholesterol phenotype of their parental ligands, which suggests that disrupting cholesterol homeostasis might contribute to the overall cytotoxicity of the drug conjugates. Furthermore, these phenomena were seen exclusively with cytotoxic S2L. Based on these findings, we conclude that S2L-mediated cell death is due to free cholesterol accumulation that leads to ER stress. Consequently, the cytotoxic profiles of S2L drug conjugates are proposed to be enhanced via concurrent ER stress inducers or simvastatin, strategies that could be instrumental on the path toward tumor eradication.","Npc1 is a cholesterol transporter located on lysosomal membrane, and whether it is involved in regulating the function and differentiation of β cells is unclear. To understand molecular basis of the phenotype caused by Npc1 loss in β cells, we isolated islets from 2-week-old WT and Npc1KO mice for single-cell sequencing. We compared the gene expression profiles of different subpopulation of islet cells and found many changes of islet subpopulation and biological pathway occurred in Npc1KO islets.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is responsible for a disproportionate number of breast cancer deaths due to its molecular heterogeneity, high recurrence rate and lack of targeted therapies. Dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway occurs in approximately 50% of TNBC patients. We performed a genome-wide negative selection CRISPR/Cas9 screen with PI3K and AKT inhibitors to identify targetable synthetic lethalities in TNBC. We found that cholesterol homeostasis is a collateral vulnerability with AKT inhibition. Disruption of cholesterol homeostasis with pitavastatin synergized with AKT inhibition to induce TNBC cytotoxicity in vitro, in mouse TNBC xenografts and in patient-derived organoids of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer. Neither ER-positive breast cancer cell lines nor ER-positive organoids were sensitive to combined AKT inhibitor and pitavastatin. Mechanistically, TNBCs show dysregulated SREBP-2 activation in response to single agent or combination AKT inhibitor and pitavastatin, and this was rescued by inhibition of the cholesterol trafficking protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). NPC1 loss promoted lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, decreased endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol levels and promoted SREBP-2 activation. Taken together, these data identify a TNBC-specific vulnerability to the combination of AKT inhibitors and pitavastatin mediated by dysregulated cholesterol trafficking. This work motivates combining AKT inhibitors with pitavastatin as a therapeutic modality in TNBC. ","Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) plays a crucial role in maintaining telomere length, which are specialised protective caps at the end of chromosomes.

To investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in AT patient samples with the aim of identifying miRNA signatures and correlate these patterns with disease pathogenesis. Twenty AT patients (mean age 17.7 + 9.6 years) were enrolled in the study. Clinical and genetic data were collected. We performed a small RNA-seq analysis in PBMCs and fibroblasts to compare miRNA expression profiles in AT patients and controls, and to identify specific expression signatures for AT. We found 42 differentially expressed (DE)-miRNAs in blood samples and 26 in fibroblasts samples. Three DE-miRNAs, miR-342-3p, miR-30a-5p, and miR-195-5p were validated in further AT samples and their dysregulation was confirmed.We identified for the first time, an AT-associated miRNA signature in blood cells and fibroblast samples obtained from a cohort of AT patients.

However, our understanding of the relationships between LSC and pre-leukemic cells is still incomplete. In particular, it is not known whether “niche-anchoring” of pre-leukemic cell affects disease evolution. To address this issue, we conditionally inactivated the adhesion molecule Jam-C expressed by haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and LSC in an inducible iMLL-AF9-driven AML mouse model. Deletion of Jam-C in HSC before activation of the leukemia-initiating iMLL-AF9 fusion resulted in a shift from long term (LT-HSC) to short term-HSC (ST-HSC) expansion, suggesting that transcriptional programs of leukemic HSC were altered. RNA sequencing performed on leukemic HSC and GMP isolated from diseased mice revealed that genes upregulated in Jam-C-deficient animals belonged to Activation Protein-1 (AP-1) and TNF-/NFB signalling pathways. Using three publicly available datasets of AML gene expression, we further showed that human orthologs of dysregulated genes belonged to a gene regulon distinct from the LSC-17 signature. A prognosis 14-genes score from the AP-1/TNF-/NFB gene expression signature was established and called ATIC for “AP-1/TNF- initiating cell”.  ATIC was independent of the LSC-17 score and improved the stratification of AML patients obtained with the LSC-17 score suggesting that the ATIC score reflected the presence of ST-HSC-initiating AML cells at diagnosis. Collectively we provide a novel tool for understanding AML disease heterogeneity through the identification of specific transcriptional programs for leukemic stem and progenitor cells.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","H3K27ac HiChIP analysis was performed in multiple myeloma cell lines and primary sample to analyze active chromatin-chromatin interactions in myeloma.","Patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) show higher levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and endothelial activation markers compared to healthy peers and altered blood transcriptome profiles. However, the characterization of the whole-blood transcriptome profile in response to exercise has not been evaluated in children with SCA. Twenty-three children/adolescents with SCA (10-19 years old) and 17 healthy controls (10-22 years old) performed eight 2-min bouts of cycle ergometry interspersed with 1-min rest intervals (50% or 70% of the peak workload achieved during the cardiopulmonary exercise test). Whole-blood transcriptome profile (RNA-seq) was performed before and after the exercise protocol. Following exercise, gene pathways associated with innate immunity were altered in both children with SCA and controls. Our results shed light on the common and different immune responses to acute exercise at the molecular level in children with SCA and healthy controls.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belonging to a family of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) is pathomechanistically associated with the group of polyglutamine expansion disorders which include SCA 1-3, 6, 7 and 17, and Huntington’s disease. These rare diseases share a common mutational feature that is the expansion of CAG repeat sequence in disease causing genes. These mutations lead to neuronal accumulation of expanded polyglutamine proteins and selective patterns of neurodegeneration. SCA7 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in ATAXIN-7 (ATXN7), a subcomponent of co-activatory transcriptional complex SAGA and primarily affects the cerebellum, retina and brainstem. Currently, only treatments alleviating symptoms are available to patients. Allele-selective lowering of mutant polyQ proteins promises to have high therapeutic outcomes and safety profiles. In this study, PhP.eB  adeno-associated virus (AAV PhP.eB) was used to deliver several shRNAs targeting expanded CAG repeats that were tested for their safety and efficacy to lower the mATXN7 level in the brain. The SCA7140Q/5Q knock-in mice that expresses a mutated Atxn7 allele harboring an expansion of 140 CAG triplet repeats and the wild type mouse allele with 5 CAGs were used in the study. Our SCA7 140Q/5Q KI mouse model remarkably recapitulates cardinal features of SCA7 and bears the potential for pre-clinical trials (Niewiadomska-Cimicka et al., J.Neurosci., 2021). We showed that systemic injection of the AAV-shA4, the most allele-selective and safe reagent of our collection, results in improvement of motor phenotypes as indicated in open field test, and partial correction of transcriptional alterations in the cerebellum of SCA7 mice.","Neurodegeneration in the human population is often associated with loss of protein homeostasis that is driven by accumulation of specific aggregated proteins. Here we investigate whether deficiency in Senataxin, an RNA-DNA helicase associated with cerebellar ataxia and ALS, induces destabilization of intrinsically disordered proteins as we previously found with Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and tissue. We find that Senataxin loss does generate protein aggregates but, unlike in A-T, these are associated with the nucleolus and are independent of oxidative stress and PARP activity. Non-coding RNA expression from the intergenic spacer region of ribosomal DNA is induced in the absence of Senataxin and drives the association and aggregation of many proteins known to be prone to aggregation in neurodegenerative disease. Both non-coding RNAs and protein aggregates are eliminated by overexpression of RNaseH1, implicating RNA-DNA hybrids as the key driver of these outcomes. We find that hybrids are high in the absence of Senataxin at intergenic sites, not at annotated protein-coding genes; these include sites of Senataxin binding in the genome, ribosomal DNA, and peri-centromeric regions. These findings suggest that destabilization of the proteome is driven by Senataxin loss and that RNA-DNA hybrids and non-coding RNAs play a critical role in this process.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The epigenome of stem cells occupies a critical interface between genes and environment, serving to regulate expression through modification by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We hypothesized that aging and obesity, which represent major risk factors for a variety of diseases, synergistically modify the epigenome of adult adipose stem cells (ASCs). Using integrated RNA- and targeted bisulfite-sequencing in murine ASCs from lean and obese mice at 5- and 12-months of age, we identified global DNA hypomethylation with either aging or obesity, and a synergistic effect of aging combined with obesity. The transcriptome of ASCs in lean mice was relatively stable to the effects of age, but this was not true in obese mice. Functional pathway analyses identified a subset of genes with critical roles in progenitors and in diseases of obesity and aging. Specifically, Mapt, Nr3c2, App, and Ctnnb1 emerged as potential hypomethylated upstream regulators in both aging and obesity (AL vs. YL and AO vs. YO), and App, Ctnnb1, Hipk2, Id2, and Tp53 exhibited additional effects of aging in obese animals. Furthermore, Foxo3 and Ccnd1 were potential hypermethylated upstream regulators of healthy aging (AL vs. YL), and of the effects of obesity in young animals (YO vs. YL), suggesting that these factors could play a role in accelerated aging with obesity. Finally, we identified candidate driver genes that appeared recurrently in all analyses and comparisons undertaken.

Oncoretroviral overexpression of wildtype Hoxa1 cDNA (WT-Hoxa1), which generates both Hoxa1 isoforms, in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) perturbed hematopoiesis, resulting in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in mice. Overexpression of a mutated Hoxa1 cDNA (MUT-Hoxa1) that generates Hoxa1-FL but not Hoxa1-T led to a more severe MDS capable of transforming to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Similar to human MDS, DNA damage repair pathways were downregulated in Hoxa1-overexpressing hematopoietic progenitor cells. Conditional knock-in mouse models revealed a Hoxa1-FL dosage-dependent effect on MDS disease severity. Our data reveal that increased expression of Hoxa1-FL in HSPCs is sufficient to initiate MDS in mice. CD34+ cells from up to 50% of patients with MDS had elevated HOXA1-FL expression, highlighting the clinical relevance of our mouse models.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Single cell RNA sequencing, 5 week deletion of  O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in hepatocytes","γδ T cells perform heterogeneous functions in homeostasis and disease across tissues. However, it is unclear whether these roles correspond to distinct γδ subsets or to a homogeneous population of cells exerting context-dependent functions. Here, by cross-organ multimodal single-cell profiling, we reveal that various mouse tissues harbor unique site-adapted γδ subsets. Epidermal and intestinal intraepithelial γδ T cells are transcriptionally homogeneous and exhibit epigenetic hallmarks of functional diversity. Through parabiosis experiments, we uncovered cellular states associated with cytotoxicity, innate-like rapid IFN-γ production and tissue repair functions displaying tissue residency hallmarks. Notably, our observations nuance the link between IL-17-producing γδ T cells and tissue residency. Moreover, transcriptional programs associated with tissue-resident γδ T cells are analogous to those of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells. Altogether, this study provides the first multimodal landscape of tissue-adapted γδ T cells, revealing heterogeneity, lineage relationships and their tissue residency program. ","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enable hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) through their ability to replenish the entire blood system. Proliferation of HSCs is linked to decreased reconstitution potential, and a precise regulation of actively dividing HSCs is thus essential to ensure long-term functionality. This regulation becomes important in the transplantation setting where HSCs undergo proliferation followed by a gradual transition to quiescence and homeostasis. While mouse HSCs have been well studied during homeostatic conditions, the mechanisms regulating HSC activation during stress remain unclear. Here, we analyzed the different phases of regeneration following transplantation.  We isolated bone marrow from mice at eight time points after transplantation and examined the reconstitution dynamics and transcriptional profiles of stem and progenitor populations. We found that regenerating HSCs initially produced rapidly expanding progenitors and displayed distinct changes in fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis. Moreover, we observed molecular changes in cell cycle, MYC and mTOR signaling in both HSCs and the progenitor subsets. We used a decay rate model to fit the temporal transcription profiles of regenerating HSCs and identified genes with progressively decreased or increased expression after transplantation. These genes overlapped to a large extent with published gene sets associated with key aspects of HSC function demonstrating the potential of this data set as a resource for identification of novel HSC regulators. Taken together, our study provides a detailed functional and molecular characterization of HSCs at different phases of regeneration and identifies a gene set associated with the transition from proliferation to quiescence.","A mouse model lacking systemic expression of Pank1 together with neuronal deletion of Pank2 was generated and revealed a developmental requirement for CoA that, when deficient, resulted in abnormal motor behavior preceding early death.  Neuronal Pank2 expression in Pank1-/-Syn-Pank2-/- double knockout mice (dKO) decreased starting at P9-11 and brain CoA levels did not increase subsequently, in contrast to wild-type matched control animals.  The Pank1-/-Syn-Pank2-/- dKO mice developed a forelimb deformity and abnormal gait behavior, similar to PKAN patients, and lost weight when brain CoA became depressed relative to wild-type levels.  Comparative gene expression analysis revealed significant alteration of a relatively small selection of genes, including reduction of gene transcripts affecting heme and hemoglobin synthesis together with upregulation of gene transcripts related to the response to oxygen/glucose deprivation.","RNA-seq was carried out as described by Simone Picelli et al. with minor modifications (Genome Res 2014;24:2033-40). Briefly, RNA was extracted from 5000 cells using a miRNeasy Micro Kits (Qiagen, German). RNA quality was assessed with an Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, cat#5067-1513, USA) on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Each library was prepared from 2ng of total RNA. After reverse transcription, cDNA was amplified for 8 cycles followed by Agencourt AMPure XP purification, the quality of cDNA library was checked on an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies, cat#5067-4626). The cDNA was sheared to a 200-500 bp size range using the Covaris AFA system. The final library was carried out by using the NEB Next ULTRA II DNA Prep Kit, and their quality and size were checked using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit. The libraries were sequenced using a Hiseq 4000 system (Illumina, USA). At least million reads were obtained for each sample. For all RNA-seq reads, we cut the 5’ adaptor (AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACAT GGG) using cutadapt (version 1.10) with the parameter –e 0.17, and then aligned to the hg19 genome using OSA (version 2.10.8). The aligned data were merged and count by Samtools (version 0.1.19+), and differentially expressed genes were found based on the edgeR with default parameters (Bioinformatics 2010;26:139-40). A gene was differentially expressed if (1) p &lt; 0.05 (2) |log2(fold change)| &gt; 1. For hierarchical clustering, the RPKM values of differentially expressed genes were log2-transformed and standardized. 1- Pearson correlation was then used as the distance for clustering. Differentially expressed genes were selected for GO analysis using R package clusterProfiler (Omics 2012;16:284-7).","Adoptive T-cell immunotherapy provides a promising approach to cancer therapy. Stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells have been proposed as a new class of memory T cells that possess longevity and a high proliferative potential. It has been shown that CD8+ TSCM cells can be generated in vitro from naïve CD8+ T cells via Wnt signaling; however, the methods for inducing TSCM cells from activated or memory T cells remain to be developed. Here, we established a new strategy for generating TSCM-like cells in vitro (designated as “iTSCM” cells) from activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice and humans by coculturing with stromal cells expressing a Notch ligand. These iTSCM cells lost PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression and produced a large number of tumor-specific effector cells after restimulation. The present study illustrates a novel approach to generating a large number of antigen-specific effector T cells for adoptive immunotherapy.","Normal liver tissues","CD8+CD45RA+CD45RO-CCR7+CD95+ T cells cocultured with OP9-hDL3","RSK1 is an exploitable dependency in myeloid malignancies","RSK1 is an exploitable dependency in myeloid malignancies","RSK1 is an exploitable dependency in myeloid malignancies","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","We present the first experimental evidence that loss of DNA methylation at late-replicating regions, widely documented in aging and cancer, is directly driven by cell division. DNA hypomethylation, particularly at low-density CpGs in A:T-rich, partially methylated domains (PMD solo-WCGWs), tracks cumulative population doublings in primary cell culture. Cell cycle deceleration or full arrest resulted in a proportional decrease in the rate of DNA methylation loss.   Lower culture oxygen conditions resulted in a slowed rate of methylation loss, suggesting that these CpGs may also be vulnerable to methylation loss during unscheduled, repair-associated methylation maintenance as well as scheduled, replication-associated methylation maintenance.  By studying this methylation context in immortalized primary cells, we identified genomic and epigenomic features that are resistant or more susceptible to methylation loss. Finally, we leveraged this extensive DNA methylation dataset to develop a refined metric for the relative cumulative mitotic histories of human cells. These RNA-sequencing data accompany the larger DNA methylation dataset.","We present the first experimental evidence that loss of DNA methylation at late-replicating regions, widely documented in aging and cancer, is directly driven by cell division.

The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 850,000 CpGs in postmortem human frontal cortex samples from European donors in the Netherlands Brain Bank. Following quality checks, sample filtering and normalization, association between CpG methylation and Braak alpha-synuclein stage was assessed using linear models.","Controlling fatty acid uptake, lipid production and storage, and metabolism of lipid droplets (LDs), is closely related to lipid homeostasis, adipocyte hypertrophy and obesity. We report here that stomatin, a major constituent of lipid rafts, participates in adipogenesis and adipocyte maturation by modulating related signaling pathways. In adipocyte-like cells, increased stomatin promotes LD growth or enlargements by facilitating LD-LD fusion, as well as fatty acid uptake from extracellular environment by recruiting effector molecules, such as FAT/CD36 translocase, to lipid rafts to promote internalization of fatty acids. Stomatin transgenic mice fed with high-fat diets exhibit obesity, insulin resistance and hepatic impairments; however, such phenotypes are not seen if feeding the transgenic animals with regular diets. Inhibitions of stomatin by gene knockdown or OB-1 pharmacological treatments inhibit adipogenic differentiation and LD growth through downregulation of PPARγ pathway. Effects of stomatin on PPARγ involve ERK signaling; however, an alternate pathway may also exist. Differential expression analyses by microarray were performed comparing stomatin-knockdown and control 3T3-L1 adipocyte-like cells.","The H19X-encoded miR-424(322)/503 cluster regulates multiple cellular functions. Here we report for the first time that it is also a critical linchpin of fat mass expansion. Deletion of this miRNA cluster in mice results in obesity, while increasing the pool of early adipocyte progenitors and hypertrophied adipocytes. Complementary loss and gain of function experiments and RNA sequencing demonstrate that miR-424(322)/503 regulates a conserved genetic program involved in the differentiation and commitment of white adipocytes. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-424(322)/503 targets γ-Synuclein (SNCG), a factor that mediates this program rearrangement by controlling metabolic functions in fat cells, allowing adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue enlargement. Accordingly, diminished miR-424(322) in mice and obese humans co-segregates with increased SNCG in fat and peripheral blood as mutually exclusive features of obesity, being normalized upon weight loss. Our data unveil a previously unknown regulatory mechanism of fat mass expansion tightly controlled by the miR-424(322)/503 through SNCG.","DNA replication timing and 3D chromatin organisation are associated with epigenomic changes across large domains during human differentiation and cancer progression. However, it is unclear if epigenome changes, in particular cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation, is a consequence or cause of changes observed in higher order genome architecture. Here, we compare replication timing profiles and three dimensional (3D) genome organisation, using Hi-C and single cell Repli-Seq in the DNMT1 and DNMT3B DNA methyltransferases double knockout hypomethylated DKO1 colorectal cancer cell line and its parental HCT116 cell line. We find that the hypomethylated cells show a profound loss of replication timing precision, gain of single cell replication timing heterogeneity and loss of chromatin conformation integrity. Discrete regions, that undergo a large change in replication timing in the hypomethylated cells, are associated with a loss of allelic replication timing and shrinking of late replicating Partially Methylated Domain (PMD) boundaries. In contrast, conservation of replication timing after DNA methylation depletion at PMDs is associated with the formation of new H3K9me3/H3K4me3 bivalent domains which may serve to prevent ectopic transcription and maintain cell viability. Together our results show that a loss of global methylation, a common hallmark of cancer, directly impacts on the precision of replication timing and contribute to deregulation of the 3D chromatin architecture.","DNA replication timing and 3D chromatin organisation are associated with epigenomic changes across large domains during human differentiation and cancer progression.

Global loss of DNA methylation and genomic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a hallmark of human cancers. Here, we used our recently developed single base resolution approaches, hmTOP-seq and uTOP-seq, for construction of 5hmC maps and identification of large hypomethylated domains (PMDs) in different NB cell subpopulations. The 5hmC profiles revealed distinct signatures characteristic of different cell lineages and stages of malignant transformation of NB cells in a conventional and oxygen depleted environment, which often occurs in tumours. The analysis of the cell type-specific PMD distribution highlighted differences in global genome organization among NB cells that were ascribed to the same lineage identity by transcriptome assays. Collectively, we demonstrated a high informativeness of the integrative epigenomic and transcriptomic research in relation to large scale genome structure in investigating the mechanisms that regulate cell identities and developmental stages of NB cells. Such multi-omics analysis, as compared to mutational studies, open new ways for identification of novel disease-associated features which bring prognostic and therapeutic value in treating this aggressive pediatric disease.","Microglia are specialized macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) and first to react to pathogens or injury. Transcriptional profiling significantly contributed to our understanding of microglia functions. In the case of human CNS samples, a postmortem delay (PMD) in tissue access and collection is the potential factor that might affect microglia gene expression profiles. However, the direct analysis of effects of PMD on human microglia transcriptome is challenging due to many confounding factors such as sex, aging, nutrition, lifestyle, medication and medical history. To determine the effects of PMD on the microglia transcriptome. Here, we analyzed mouse microglia, where ante-mortem conditions and post-mortem delay can be tightly controlled. PMD had very limited effect on mouse microglia gene expression, only 50 genes (out of 15,554 detected genes) were differentially expressed between different PMDs.","Partially methylated domains (PMDs) are a hallmark of epigenomes in reproducible and specific biological contexts, including cancer cells, the placenta, and cultured cell lines. Existing methods for deciding whether PMDs exist in a sample, as well as their identification, are few, often tailored to specific biological questions, and require high coverage samples for accurate identification. In this study, we outline a set of axioms that take a step towards a functional definition for PMDs, describe an improved method for comparable PMD detection across samples with substantially different sequencing depths, and refine the decision criteria for whether a sample contains PMDs using a data-driven approach. Applying our method to 267 methylomes from 7 species, we corroborated recent results regarding the general association between replication timing and PMD state, and report identification of several reproducibly “escapee” genes within late-replicating domains that escape the downregulation and hypomethylation of their immediate genomic neighborhood. We also explored the discordant PMD state of orthologous genes between human and mouse, and observed a directional association of PMD state with gene expression and local gene density. Our improved method makes low-sequencing, population-level studies of PMD variation possible and our results further refine the model of PMD formation as one where sequence context and regional epigenomic features both play a role in gradual genome-wide hypomethylation.","Targeted epigenomic profiling method CUT&amp;RUN was used to examine PPHLN-regulated H3K9me3 deposition on chromatin.","Targeted epigenomic profiling methods CUT&amp;RUN and CUT&amp;Tag were used to examine TASOR genome binding and TASOR-regulated H3K9me3 deposition on chromatin.","Background and aims: Metabolic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia, are significant public health concerns worldwide. The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene have been implicated in various physiological processes, but its specific role in lipid metabolism remains unclear. We aim to elucidate the role of IGF2 in regulating lipid metabolism in adipose tissues and its association with metabolic syndrome (MetS).  Methods: The research employed a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the role of IGF2 in lipid metabolism. We investigated the correlation between genetic variations within the IGF2 gene and metabolic parameters. We conduct a cross-sectional human study to evaluate relationships between varying IGF2 serum concentrations and the incidence of MetS. Additionally, manipulation of IGF2 expression levels in mouse and cell models via overexpression and knockdown to assess impacts on lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, specifically lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis. Furthermore, the study employs metabolomics techniques to scrutinize the broader metabolic profiles in adipose tissues in response to IGF2 modulation.  Results: Multiple SNP loci in the IGF2 gene were significantly associated with BMI, HbA1c, and diabetes. Insufficient or excessive expression of IGF2 was identified as a risk factor for hyperlipidemia, low HDL-c, and central obesity in MetS. We observed that IGF2 was mainly concentrated in adipose tissues and adipocytes. Enhanced IGF2 expression stimulated adipogenesis and lipid accumulation, whereas IGF2 knockdown hindered lipolysis, exacerbating ectopic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. There is a substantial enlargement of pancreatic tissue and heightened insulin generation in mice deficient in IGF2. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway through IGF1R in IGF2 excess or INSR in conditions of IGF2 scarcity, along with inhibition of AMPK, implies a common downstream process that favors lipid accumulation and metabolic reprogramming in adipocytes.  Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that upregulation of IGF2 enhanced adipogenesis and lipogenesis, while knockdown of IGF2 inhibited lipolysis, which resulting in accelerating lipid accumulation through PI3K/Akt-AMPK pathway.","Highly mutable pathogens generate viral diversity that impacts virulence, transmissibility, treatment, and thwarts acquired immunity.  We previously described C19-SPAR-Seq, a high-throughput, next-generation sequencing platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 that we deployed to systematically profile variant dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 for over 3 years in a large, North American urban environment (Toronto, Canada). Sequencing of the ACE2 receptor binding motif and polybasic furin cleavage site of Spike in over 70,000 patients revealed that population sweeps of canonical variants of concern (VOCs) occurred in repeating wavelets. Furthermore, we found that subvariants and putative quasi-species with alterations characteristic of future VOCs and/or predicted to be functionally important arose frequently, but always extinguished. Systematic screening of functionally relevant domains in pathogens could thus provide a powerful tool for monitoring spread and mutational trajectories, particularly those with zoonotic potential.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Highly mutable pathogens generate viral diversity that impacts virulence, transmissibility, treatment, and thwarts acquired immunity.

Interferon is only effective to inhibit hantavirus infection at a very early stage. Several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been indicated to inhibit hantavirus infection. The cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) has been indicated as an ISG, which encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). 25HC plays an important role in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis and inhibits multiple enveloped virus infections. Here, we showed that Hantaan virus (HTNV), the prototype hantavirus, induces CH25H in infected cells. Overexpression of CH25H and treatment of its enzymatic product 25HC both inhibit HTNV infection, possibly through lowering 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase regulation (HMG-CoA reductase, HMGCR) that inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Additionally, cholesterol lowering drugs, HMGCR-targeting statins process potent hantavirus inhibition effects. Taken together, our results indicate that the 25HC and statins were potential antivirals against hantavirus infection.","Antiviral CD8+ T cell immunity depends on the integration of varying contextual cues, but how antigen presenting cells (APC ) consolidate these signals for decoding by T cells remains unclear. We describe gradual IFN-α/β-induced transcriptional adaptations that endowed APC with the capacity to rapidly activate the transcriptional regulators P65, IRF1 and FOS upon CD4+ T cell-mediated CD40 stimulation. While these responses operated through broadly utilized signaling components, they induced a unique set of costimulatory molecules and soluble mediators that could not be elicited by IFN-α/β or CD40 alone. This response was critical for the acquisition of antiviral CD8+ T cell effector function, and its activity in APC from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) correlated with milder disease. These observations uncover a sequential integration process whereby APC rely on CD4+ T cells to select the innate circuits that guide antiviral CD8+ T cell responses.","Pathogenic variants in subunits of RNA polymerase (Pol) III cause a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases including 4H leukodystrophy. We developed a postnatal whole-body mouse model expressing pathogenic mutations in Polr3a to examine the molecular mechanisms by which reduced Pol III activity results primarily in central nervous system phenotypes. Polr3a mutant mice exhibit behavioral deficits, exocrine pancreatic atrophy and cerebral pathology. Transcriptome and immunohistochemistry analyses of cerebra show a reduction in most Pol III transcripts, induction of innate immune and integrated stress responses and cell type-specific gene expression changes reflecting neuron and oligodendrocyte loss and microglial activation. A global decrease in mature tRNA levels and an altered tRNA profile preceded cerebral neurodegeneration suggesting a causal role in disease initiation. In cerebella, heart and kidney, Pol III transcripts other than tRNAs were generally unaffected. The results suggest tissue-specific thresholds of sensitivity to defects in Pol III transcription.","Pathogenic variants in subunits of RNA polymerase (Pol) III cause a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases including 4H leukodystrophy.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is involved in the development of ascites syndrome (AS) in broiler chickens. Therefore, studying the effect of HIF-1α on the cellular transcriptome under hypoxic conditions will help to better understand the mechanism of HIF-1α in the development of AS in broilers. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profile of the DF-1 cell line under hypoxic conditions by RNA-seq. Additionally, we constructed the HIF-1α knockdown DF-1 cell line by using the RNAi method and analyzed the gene expression profile under hypoxic conditions. The results showed that exposure to hypoxia for 48 hours had a significant impact on the expression of genes in the DF-1 cell line, which related to cell proliferation, stress response, and apoptosis. In addition, after HIF-1α knockdown more differential expression genes appeared than in wild-type cells, and the expression of most hypoxia-related genes was either down-regulated or remained unchanged. Pathway analysis results showed that differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in pathways related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative phosphorylation. Our study obtained transcriptomic data from chicken fibroblasts at different hypoxic times and identified the potential regulatory network associated with HIF-1α. This data provides valuable support for understanding the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of HIF-1α in the development of AS in broilers.","Mutations in MECP2 give rise to Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked neurodevelop- mental disorder that results in broad cognitive impairments in females. While the exact etiology of RTT symptoms remains unknown, one possible explanation for its clinical presentation is that loss of MeCP2 causes miswiring of neural circuits due to defects in the brain’s capacity to respond to changes in neuronal activity and sensory experience. Here, we show that MeCP2 is phosphorylated at four residues in the brain (S86, S274, T308, and S421) in response to neuronal activity, and we generate a quadruple knock-in (QKI) mouse line in which all four activity-dependent sites are mutated to alanines to prevent phosphorylation. QKI mice do not display overt RTT phenotypes or detectable gene expression changes in two brain regions. However, electrophysiological recordings from the retinogeniculate synapse of QKI mice reveal that while synapse elimination is initially normal at P14, it is significantly compromised at P20. Notably, this phenotype is distinct from the synapse refinement defect previously reported for Mecp2 null mice, where synapses initially refine but then regress after the third postnatal week. We thus propose a model in which activity-induced phosphorylation of MeCP2 is critical for the proper timing of retinogeniculate synapse maturation specifically during the early postnatal period.","We sought to determine the transcriptomic impacts of artemisinin, Artemisia annua extract, and Artemisia afra extract on M. tuberculosis. Log phase cultures were treated with lethal doses for four hours or with inhibitory or sub-inhibitory doses for 24 hours. RNA was collected from untreated controls at the same timepoint.","In different preclinical studies, different sources of MSCs derived from adipose tissue, bone marrow, placenta, umbilical cord have shown effectiveness in treating ARDS. However, their clinical translation has not been effective as demonstrated by variable outcomes from clinical trials. One reason for this could be the MSC source chosen for clinical translation as there is lack of study comparing the different sources of MSCs. In previous work, we performed a “head-to-head” comparison between different sources of MSCs and showed that each source had a unique genomic and proteomic “signature”. Hence, in this current study, we investigated the choice of MSC source best suited for therapy in an LPS-induced mouse model of ARDS.  We compare the 3 most commonly used MSC sources: bone marrow derived-MSCs (BM-MSCs), adipose tissue derived-MSCs (AD-MSCs) and umbilical cord derived-MSCs (UC-MSCs) therapy in LPS-induced ARDS model where we did bulk RNA sequencing of the lungs to validate the efficacy of therapy in terms of different changes in gene label and different pathways involved.","Elevation of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) has recently emerged as a key driver of cancer cachexia, a syndrome of extreme weight loss that affects patients with various types of cancer. Chemotherapy, as well as the tumour itself have been reported to contribute to increased GDF15 secretion in both cancer and host tissues. Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) domain proteins have been shown to regulate GDF15 expression in pancreatic cancer cells. With currently neither preventive strategies nor specific therapeutic options for cachexia available, antibodies targeting GDF15 or its receptor are being developed. However, the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced GDF15 upregulation in tumour and host cells is still unknown, leaving uncertainty about safety and efficacy of therapies targeting retrospective reduction of GDF15 in cancer cachexia. We tested various cardiotoxic drugs for their effect on GDF15 regulation in cardiomyocyte cell culture and analysed gene expression, mutational status, and pathway activities of the NCI-60 cancer cell line panels to get further insights into the regulation of GDF15 expression in both cancer and host cells upon treatment with anticancer drugs. To investigate the regulatory effect of BET inhibition on GDF expression more extensively, we screened BET inhibitors in doxorubicin treated human cardiomyocyte cell culture as well as in 21 cancer cell lines and performed differential analysis of gene expression, metabolites, and pathway activities. Our results reveal that DNA interacting compounds induce GDF15 expression in human cardiomyocytes up to 20-fold, whereas cardiotoxic drugs with other modes of action led, if at all, to less than 3-fold induction. We discovered that BET inhibitors suppress doxorubicin-induced GDF15 overexpression in human cardiomyocytes up to 7.4-fold (p=0.0051). In cancer cell lines, we identified compound-specific gene signatures that correlate with the extent of GDF15 induction upon treatment in the espective cell line. BET inhibition also reduces GDF15 expression in a defined subset of cancer cell lines that differentiate from the other tested cell lines in a less active PI3K/Akt axis and significantly higher extracellular pantothenate concentration (p=0.00095). We identified compound- and cell-line-specific gene signatures that predict GDF15 upregulation upon treatment, providing indication that the risk for drug-induced GDF15 overexpression and concomitant cachexia can be reduced by a biomarker-driven selection of patient-specific anticancer agents. Our results suggest that BET inhibitors could counteract cachexia at the transcriptional level in tumour and host tissues by reducing GDF15 expression. We identified characteristic gene and metabolite expressions of responsive cancer cell lines that can serve as biomarkers for patient selection.","Elevation of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) has recently emerged as a key driver of cancer cachexia, a syndrome of extreme weight loss that affects patients with various types of cancer.

Conversely, data on their effects on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 18 are lacking. We evaluated these effects by feeding APOE*3-Leiden mice a Western-type diet (WTD) 19 with or without atorvastatin to induce NASH and hepatic fibrosis. Besides the well-known plasma 20 cholesterol lowering (-30%) and anti-atherogenic effects (severe lesion size -48%), atorvastatin sig-21 nificantly reduced hepatic steatosis (-22%), the number of aggregated inflammatory cells in the liver 22 (-80%) and hepatic fibrosis (-92%) compared to WTD-fed mice. Furthermore, atorvastatin-treated 23 mice showed less immunohistochemically stained area of inflammation markers. Atorvastatin pre-24 vented accumulation of free cholesterol in the form of cholesterol crystals (-78%). Cholesterol crys-25 tals are potent inducers of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and atorvastatin prevented its acti-26 vation, which resulted in reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β 27 (-61%) and IL-18 (-26%). Transcriptome analysis confirmed strong reducing effects of atorvastatin 28 on inflammatory mediators, including NLRP3, NFκB and TLR4. The present study demonstrates 29 that atorvastatin reduces hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis and prevents cholesterol crys-30 tal formation, thereby precluding NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This may render atorvastatin 31 treatment as an attractive approach to reduce NAFLD and prevent progression into NASH in 32 dyslipidemic patients.","B cell somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection in germinal center (GC)s enhance antibody affinity to antigen. Conventional understanding holds that SHM enhances pre-existing antibody specificities, limiting the scope of SHM-based antibody evolution to those established in the primary repertoire through V(D)J recombination. By tracking pre-defined non-specific B cells, we observed consistent SHM in non-cognate antibody genes after immunization in settings of diverse, polyclonal B and T cells. Removing B cell competition enabled these non-specific yet somatically mutating antibodies to develop entirely new specificities to diverse antigens. Our findings introduce an updated model, where SHM drives antibody diversification without requiring initial antigen specificity. This reveals that B cell competition, rather than a necessity for specific affinity, limits the emergence of new affinities (termed here as affinity birth) by SHM and highlights the mammalian adaptive immune system’s capacity to explore antibody-antigen interactions beyond the epitopes targeted by the V(D)J-dependent primary antibody repertoire.","Self-antigens abnormally expressed on tumors, such as MUC1, have been targeted by therapeutic cancer vaccines. We recently assessed in two clinical trials in a preventative setting whether immunity induced with a MUC1 peptide vaccine could reduce high colon cancer risk in individuals with a history of premalignant colon adenomas. In both trials, there were immune responders and non-responders to the vaccine. Here we used PBMC pre-vaccination and 2 weeks after the first vaccine of responders and non-responders selected from both trials to identify early biomarkers of immune response involved in longterm memory generation and prevention of adenoma recurrence. We performed flow cytometry, phosflow, and differential gene expression analyses on PBMCs collected from MUC1 vaccine responders and non-responders pre-vaccination and two weeks after the first of three vaccine doses. MUC1 vaccine responders had higher frequencies of CD4 cells pre-vaccination, increased expression of CD40L on CD8 and CD4 T-cells, and a greater increase in ICOS expression on CD8 T-cells. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that iCOSL, PI3K AKT MTOR, and B-cell signaling pathways are activated early in response to the MUC1 vaccine. We identified six specific transcripts involved in elevated antigen presentation, B-cell activation, and NF-kB1 activation that were directly linked to finding antibody response at week 12. Finally, a model using these transcripts was able to predict non-responders with accuracy. These findings suggest that individuals who can be predicted to respond to the MUC1 vaccine, and potentially other vaccines, have greater readiness in all immune compartments to present and respond to antigens. Predictive biomarkers of MUC1 vaccine response may lead to more effective vaccines tailored to individuals with high risk for cancer but with varying immune fitness.","The epigenome is a target for environmental exposures, and a potential determinant of inter-individual differences in response.  In genetically identical C57Bl/6 mice exposed from gestation to weaning to the endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) tributyltin (TBT), tumor development later in life varied across multiple cohorts over time and depending on sex and diet.  In one cohort where approximately half of TBT-exposed male mice developed tumors at 10 months (Katz, 2020), transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and epigenomic (ChIP-seq) profiling was performed on blood and liver tissue from mice that developed tumors (i.e. “high-risk”) and equivalently exposed mice did not (i.e “low-risk”).  Blood transcriptomic signatures separated TBT-exposed from vehicle controls but did not discriminate between animals that developed tumors vs those that did not.  However, uninvolved liver tissue of mice with tumors exhibited transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures distinct from liver tissue of mice without tumors and had many features in common with tumors.  These high-risk transcriptomic and epigenomic features were also found in 10/26 TBT-exposed mice at 5 months, indicating that this risk signature preceded tumor development.  Thus, while early life exposure to TBT exhibits variable penetrance for tumor development, indicating TBT-exposure is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, increased risk for tumor development is linked to epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming of the liver induced by this EDC.","The IL-2 receptor α chain (IL-2Rα/CD25) is constitutively expressed on double-negative (DN2/DN3 thymocytes and regulatory T cells (Tregs) but induced by IL-2 on T and natural killer (NK) cells, with Il2ra expression regulated by a STAT5-dependent super-enhancer. We investigated CD25 regulation and function using a series of mice with deletions spanning STAT5-binding elements. Deleting the upstream super-enhancer region mainly affected constitutive CD25 expression on DN2/DN3 thymocytes and Tregs, with these mice developing autoimmune alopecia, whereas deleting an intronic region decreased IL-2-induced CD25 on peripheral T and NK cells. Thus, distinct super-enhancer elements preferentially control constitutive versus inducible expression in a cell type-specific manner. The mediator-1 coactivator colocalized with specific STAT5-binding sites. Moreover, both upstream and intronic regions had extensive chromatin interactions, and deletion of either region altered the super-enhancer structure in mature T cells. These results demonstrate differential functions for distinct super-enhancer elements, thereby indicating previously unknown ways to manipulate CD25 expression in a cell type-specific fashion.","Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells regulate vascular changes crucial for placental function and fetal growth. The functional capacity of uNK cells is shaped by their education status.  To explore the mechanisms of uNK cell education, we isolated NKG2A+ and Ly49C/I+ educated uNK cells and compared their transcriptomes to uneducated NKG2A-Ly49C/I- uNK cells.","The hypothalamus (HYP) underlies basal endocrine, physiological, and behavioral drives which inherently differ across species and sexes—ranging from growth and puberty to appetite and metabolism to social behavior. Especially in the rodent brain, these sex-differentiated functions correspond to differences in the volume, cell types, and gene expression of distinct HYP subareas. Recent studies have elucidated the transcriptional profile of single cells in the rodent ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and arcuate (ARC), which influence appetitive/social behaviors and growth/metabolism, respectively. However, there is a paucity of studies examining the molecular architecture of the adult human HYP, and transcriptional sex differences in the human VMH and ARC have not been characterized in single-cell or spatial contexts. Using 10x Genomics Visium and Xenium platforms, we generated a multimodal, spatially-resolved molecular atlas of human postmortem VMH and ARC from male and female adult donors. Sex-differential gene expression analysis within these regions revealed correlated autosomal expression differences, with stronger overall sex effects in the ARC. We then leveraged the single-cell-resolution of Xenium to localize sex-differential expression to cell types, finding most occur in ESR1- and KISS1-expressing neurons of the ARC. Finally, we investigated VMH and ARC gene expression in relation to genes associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, identifying a striking enrichment of genes upregulated in the male VMH for known and candidate risk genes for autism spectrum disorders. This work provides a multisample view of the human VMH and ARC in young/middle adulthood across both sexes, including data at both transcriptome-wide and single-cell resolutions, the first single-cell transcriptional atlas of molecular sex differences in the adult human VMH and ARC, and highlights potential sex-differentiated roles for VMH and ARC in neurobehavioral disorders.","Background:  In acute kidney injury, macrophages play a major role in regulating inflammation. Classically activated macrophages (M1) undergo drastic metabolic reprogramming during their differentiation and upregulate the aerobic glycolysis pathway to fulfill their pro-inflammatory functions. NAD+ regeneration is crucial for the maintenance of glycolysis and the most direct pathway by which this occurs is via the fermentation of pyruvate to lactate, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Our previous study determined that LDHA is predominantly expressed in the proximal segments of the nephron in the mouse kidney and increases with hypoxia. This study investigates the potential of LDHA as a therapeutic target for inflammation by exploring its role in macrophage function in vitro. Methods:  Bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from myeloid-specific LDHA knockout mice derived from crossbreeding LysM-Cre transgenic mice and LDHA floxed mice. RNA sequencing and LC-MS/MS metabolomics analyses were used in this study to determine the effect of LDHA deletion on BMDM following stimulation with IFN-γ. Results: LDHA deletion in IFN-γ BMDMs resulted in a significant alteration of the macrophage activation and functional pathways, and change in glycolytic, cytokine, and chemokine gene expression. Metabolite concentrations associated with pro-inflammatory macrophage profiles were diminished while anti-inflammatory-associated ones were increased in LDHA KO BMDMs. Glutamate and amino sugars metabolic pathways were significantly affected by the LDHA deletion. A combined muti-omics analysis highlighted changes in Rap1 signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and MAPK signaling metabolism pathways. Conclusions:  Deletion of LDHA in macrophages results in a notable reduction in the pro-inflammatory profile and concurrent upregulation of anti-inflammatory pathways. These findings suggest that LDHA could serve as a promising therapeutic target for inflammation, a key contributor to the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury.","Evidence suggests that increases in ploidy have occurred frequently in the evolutionary history of organisms, and can serve adaptive functions to specialized, somatic cells in multicellular organisms (Edgar &amp; Orr-Weaver, 2001; Orr-Weaver, 2015; Van De Peer et al., 2017). However, the sudden multiplication of all chromosome content may present physiological challenges to the cells in which it occurs. Experimental studies have associated increases in ploidy with reduced cell survival and proliferation (Andalis et al., 2004; Fujiwara et al., 2005). To understand the physiological challenges that suddenly-increased chromosome content imposes on cells, we used S. cerevisiae cells to ask how much chromosomal DNA cells may contain, and what determines this limit. We generated polyploid cells using two distinct methods causing cells to undergo endoreplication and identified the maximum ploidy of these cells, 32-64C. We found that physical determinants that alleviate or exacerbate cell surface stress increase and decrease the limit to ploidy, respectively. We also used these cells to investigate gene expression changes associated with increased ploidy, and identified the repression of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. We propose that ploidy is inherently limited by the impacts of growth in size, which accompany whole genome duplication, to cell surface integrity.","To distinguish DNA methylation (DNAm) from cell proportion changes in whole placental tissue research, we developed a robust cell type-specific DNAm reference to estimate cell composition. We collated newly collected and existing cell type DNAm profiles quantified via Illumina EPIC or 450k microarrays. To estimate cell composition, we deconvoluted whole placental samples (n=36) with robust partial correlation based on the top 50 hyper- and hypomethylated sites per cell type. To test deconvolution performance, we evaluated RMSE in predicting principal component one of DNAm variation in 204 external placental samples. We analyzed DNAm profiles (n=368,435 sites) from 12 cell types: cytotrophoblasts (n=18), endothelial cells (n=19), Hofbauer cells (n=26), stromal cells (n=21), syncytiotrophoblasts (n=4), six lymphocyte types (n=36), and nucleated red blood cells (n=11). Median cell composition was consistent with placental biology: 60.4% syncytiotrophoblast, 17.1% stromal, 8.8% endothelial, 4.5% cytotrophoblast, 3.9% Hofbauer, 1.7% nucleated red blood cells, and 1.2% neutrophils. Our expanded reference outperformed an existing reference in predicting DNAm variation (15.4% variance explained, IQR=21.61) with cell composition estimates (RMSE:10.51 vs. 11.43, p-value&lt;0.001). This cell type reference can robustly estimate cell composition from whole placental DNAm data to detect important cell types, reveal biological mechanisms, and improve causal inference.","MEIS1 and MEIS2 encode highly conserved homeodomain transcription factors crucial for developmental processes in a wide range of tissues, including the brain. They can execute redundant functions when co-expressed in the same cell types, but their roles during early stages of neural differentiation have not been systematically compared. By separate knockout and overexpression of MEIS1 and MEIS2 in human neural stem cells, we find they control specific sets of target genes, associated with distinct biological processes. Integration of DNA binding sites with differential transcriptomics implicates MEIS1 to co-regulate gene expression by interaction with transcription factors of the SOX and FOX families. MEIS1 harbors the strongest risk factor for restless legs syndrome (RLS). Our data suggest that MEIS1 can directly regulate the RLS-associated genes NTNG1, MDGA1 and DACH1, constituting new approaches to study the elusive pathomechanism or RLS.","Leprosy is a chronic disease of the skin and peripheral nerves caused by Mycobacterium leprae. A major public health and clinical problem are leprosy reactions, which are inflammatory episodes that often contribute to nerve damage and disability. Type I reversal reactions (T1R) can occur after microbiological cure of leprosy and affect up to 50% of leprosy patients. Early intervention to prevent T1R and, hence, nerve damage, is a major focus of current leprosy control efforts. In this study, we compared transcript (i.e. isoform) expression and usage profiles from leprosy patients free of T1R at enrollment (who eventually developed T1R) against T1R-free leprosy patients. Our results showed that, at baseline, cells from T1R-destined and T1R-free subjects had no main difference in their transcripts expression and usage. However, the cells of T1R patients displayed a transcriptomic immune response to M. leprae antigens that was significantly different from the one of cells from leprosy patients who remained T1R-free. Transcripts with significantly higher upregulation in the T1R-destined group, compared to the cells from T1R-free patients, were enriched for pathways and GO terms involved in response to intracellular pathogens, apoptosis regulation and inflammatory processes. Similarly, transcript usage analysis pinpointed different transcript proportions in response to the in-vitro challenge of cells from T1R-destined patients. Hence, transcript usage in concert with transcript expression suggested a dysregulated inflammatory response including increased apoptosis regulation in the peripheral blood cells of T1R-destined patients before the onset of T1R symptoms. Combined, these results provided detailed insight into the pathogenesis of T1R.","mRNA-sequencing based transcriptome analysis was used to gain insights into the molecular basis of broad-spectrum induced resistance in rice seedlings upon exposure to the model green leaf volatile Z-3-hexenyl acetate","Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally.  Newly metastasising cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours.  There is interest in exploiting this vulnerability to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis.  Here, we show that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, including with aspirin, enhances immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelet TXA2 triggers an immunosuppressive pathway within T cells dependent upon the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor (TCR)-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases.  Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or through platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner dependent upon T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo.  These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway limiting T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing a mechanistic basis for the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.","Airway macrophages (AMs) are critical for resolving inflammation and repairing injured lung tissue, but can also contribute to the development of fibrosis.  AMs were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of Siglec-F KO and WT mice prior to and 7, 14, and 21 days after bleomycin challenge (single dose, 2.5 units/kg, IT).  RNA was isolated using the Qiagen micro plus RNA kit and 200 ng of total RNA was used to generate RNA-Seq libraries.  The libraries were run on the NovaSeq 6000 with 80 million pair-end reads per sample.","Objectives: Glycine acts in an autocrine positive feedback loop in human β cells through its ionotropic receptors (GlyRs). In type 2 diabetes (T2D), islet GlyR activity is impaired by unknown mechanisms. We sought to investigate if the GlyR dysfunction in T2D is replicated by hyperglycemia per se, and to further characterize its action in β cells and the islets.   Methods: GlyR-mediated currents were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp in human β cells from donors with or without T2D, or after high glucose culture. We also correlated glycine-induced current amplitude with transcript expression levels through patch-seq. The expression of the GlyR α1, α3, and β subunit mRNA splice variants was compared between islets from donors with and without T2D, and after high glucose culture. Insulin secretion from human islets was measured in the presence or absence of the GlyR antagonist strychnine.  Results: Gene expression of GlyRs was decreased in islets from T2D donors along with smaller GlyR-mediated currents in the β cells. Glycine-induced currents are also reduced in islets from donors without diabetes after 48 hours of culture in high glucose, along with reducedα1 subunit expression and increased  α3 subunit expression. Glycine-evoked currents are highly heterogeneous between different β cells within and between donors; inversely correlated with donor HbA1c; and significantly correlated to the expression of 99 different transcripts. Finally, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is decreased in the presence of strychnine.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulated progressive driver mutations, with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin. However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is independent of the underlying aetiologies. Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC. We generated over twenty-five new genetically-driven in vivo and in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance, and metastasis to distant organs. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human-mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard of care treatment and used a linked in vitro-in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not been linked to HCC treatment before. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard of care therapy.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide.

We investigated changes in transcriptome in Smad4 KO KvPC PDAC organoids compared to Smad4 WT KvPC PDAC organoids in monoculture or in co-culture with PSCs. We also investigated the changes in transcriptome in PSCs co-cultured with Smad4 WT or Smad4 KO KvPC PDAC organoids.","RNA-sequencing of flow-sorted Smad4 wild-type (WT) or Smad4 knockout (KO) KPC (i.e. KRASG12D; p53 mutant) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) organoids from monocultures or co-cultures with pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and RNA-sequencing of flow-sorted PSCs from the same co-cultures.

The aim was to characterise the response to SD and recovery thereafter.","How different histone methyltransferases (HMT) cooperate to progressively catalyze different methylation states of the same residue as well the functional consequences of the different methylation states are not well known. Here, we address in the context of Drosophila H3K36 methylation by using single and combinatorial RNAi of HMTs along with genome-wide MNase-ChIPseq analyses. Our study reveals that K36me1/2/3 each mark distinct chromatin compartments. Each HMT predominantly contributes to only one modification state, however our approach also identifies context-dependent cooperative and compensative patterns. Further, correlating changes in K36me1/2/3 to reader binding reveals that K36me2/3 can redundantly contribute to faithful reader binding ensuring robustness.","The impairment of the intestinal barrier will lead to the accumulation of fat and harmful substances in the liver, inducing hepatic steatosis or steatohepatitis. Zhang et al. identified NSD2 in the intestine as a novel and essential regulator of hepatic steatosis. NSD2 directly regulates transcriptional activation of ERN1 through the modification of H3 dimethylated on lysine 36 (H3K4me36), thereby activating the ERN1-JNK axis to induce inflammatory response, intestinal barrier impairment, and hepatic steatosis. This functional mechanism of NSD2 provides a potential therapeutic target for this disease.","Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-responsive transcription factor that binds at enhancers to drive terminal differentiation of the prostatic luminal epithelia. By contrast, in tumors originating from these cells, AR chromatin occupancy is extensively reprogrammed to drive hyper-proliferative, metastatic, or therapy-resistant phenotypes, the molecular mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. Here we show that the tumor-specific enhancer circuitry of AR is critically reliant on the activity of Nuclear Receptor Binding SET Domain Protein 2 (NSD2), a histone 3 lysine 36 di-methyltransferase. NSD2 is ectopically expressed in prostate cancer cells and catalytic inhibition of NSD2 impairs AR trans-activation potential through partial off-loading from over 40,000 genomic sites or greater than 65% of its cistrome. The NSD2-dependent AR sites distinctly harbor a chimeric AR-half motif juxtaposed to a FOXA1 element. Similar chimeric motifs of AR are absent at the NSD2-independent AR enhancers and contain the canonical palindromic motifs instead. Meta-analyses of AR cistromes from patient tumors uncovered chimeric AR motifs to exclusively participate in tumor-specific enhancer circuitries, with a minimal role in physiological activity of AR. Accordingly, NSD2 inactivation attenuated hallmark cancer phenotypes that were fully reinstated upon exogenous NSD2 re-expression. Inactivation of NSD2 also engendered increased dependency on its paralog NSD1, which independently maintained AR and MYC hyper-transcriptional programs in cancer cells. Therapeutically exploiting these insights, we developed a dual NSD1/2 PROTAC degrader, called LLC0150, which was preferentially cytotoxic in AR-dependent prostate cancer and synergized with enzalutamide. In a pan-cancer screen, comprising over 120 cell lines from 22 distinct lineages, NSD1/2 co-degradation triggered apoptotic cell death in AR-addicted prostate cancer as well as NSD2-altered hematologic malignancies. Altogether, we identify NSD2 as a novel subunit of the AR neo-enhanceosome that wires prostate cancer gene expression programs, positioning NSD1/2 paralog co-targeting as a novel and potent therapeutic strategy.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Purpose: Although clinical evidence suggests that high salt intake is associated with NAFLD, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We sought to investigate whether salt-induced inflammation in liver is dependent on SIRT3 reduction. Methods: 6-week-old male SIRT3 knockout or their wild-type littermates were fed with high salt diet (HSD, containing 8% NaCl) or normal salt diet (NSD, containing 0.4% NaCl) for 4 months. And then their liver tissues were removed and total RNA was extracted to perform RNA sequencing. Results: 1850 differentially upregulated expressed genes were identified when comparing HSD group (HSD1, HSD2) to NSD group (NSD WT1, NSD2). Meanwhile, 1246 differentially upregulated expressed genes in response to SIRT3 knockout were determined (each group containing 3 samples). we observed that the common genes upregulated by both HSD and knockout of SIRT3 were enriched in immune system, including Tnf, Ccl2, etc. In addition, the common genes upregulated by knockout of SIRT3 in both NSD and HSD group were still enriched in the immune system. Conclusions: Through RNA-seq, we determined that HSD-induced hepatic inflammtion was highly similar to the effect of SIRT3 knockout, suggesting that reduction of SIRT3 expression is the main reason leading to salt-induced hepatic inflammation.","Purpose: Our previous study has confirmed that reduction of SIRT3 expression is a main factor contributing to salt-induced hepatic inflammtion. Here we sought to investigate whether salt-induced SIRT3 reduction was related to epigenetic modification. Methods: 6-week-old male  wild-type mice were fed with high salt diet (HSD, containing 8% NaCl) or normal salt diet (NSD, containing 0.4% NaCl) for 4 months. And then their liver tissues were removed and subjected to bilsulfate-seq. Results: Through bisulfate-seq, we did not observe any change in DNA methylation in the CpG island of Sirt3 gene promoter region. Conclusions: Salt-induced SIRT3 reduction is not related to DNA methylation on SIRT3 gene promoter.","Purpose: Our previous study has confirmed that reduction of SIRT3 expression is a main factor contributing to salt-induced hepatic inflammtion.

And then their liver tissues were removed and subjected to ChIP-seq using antibodies against H3K27ac (ab4729), H3K4me1 (ab8895), H3K9ac (39917) and H3 (ab1791). Results: Through ChIP-seq, we observed the enrichment of H3K27ac was increased on the promoters of Sirt3 and some pro-inflammatory genes, including Ccl2, Tnf and Il6, after high salt loading. However, neither H3K4me1 nor H3K9ac displayed such phenomunum. In addition, those genes containing increased H3K27ac level in response to high salt were mainly enriched in metabolism and inflammatory pathways. And knockout of SIRT3 mainly affected genes related to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and insulin signaling pathways. Conclusions: Salt-induced SIRT3 reduction is related to the epigenetic regulation, especially H3K27ac.","Maintenance of gene expression programs requires cell-type specific barcoding of genomes through euchromatin interspaced with facultative heterochromatin domains where PRC1/2 hinder chromatin accessibility thereby repressing genes inside such domains. At heterochromatin-euchromatin borders, regulation of heterochromatin spreading may depend on transcriptional activity, histone modifiers, and chromatin barrier insulators or the borders of topological associated domain (TADs). Here we show that depletion of H3K36 di- or tri-methyl histone methyl transferases dMes-4/NSD or Hypb/dSet2 induces H3K27me3 spreading at H3K27me3 borders, accounting for the repression of hundreds of genes upon depletion of these enzymes. dMes-4/NSD influences genes within active chromatin hubs and flanked by H3K27me3 borders demarcated by a TAD border, unlike dHypb/dSet2 that protects genes near H3K27me3 borders in absence of a TAD border. Insulator mutants that disrupt 3D chromatin hubs recapitulate only the H3K27me3 spreading observed upon depletion of dMes-4/NSD, and not of Hypb/dSet2. Hi-C data demonstrate how dMes-4/NSD directly block the propagation of the long-range interactions marking the inactive TADs, onto neighbor active regions, unlike Hypb/dSet2. Our data thus show a division of labor between dMes-4/NSD and Hypb/dSet2 to protect genes against H3K27me3 silencing, highlighting a direct influence of H3K36me marks on the demarcation of H3K27me3 domains within repressive TADs.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Maintenance of gene expression programs requires cell-type specific barcoding of genomes through euchromatin interspaced with facultative heterochromatin domains where PRC1/2 hinder chromatin accessibility thereby repressing genes inside such domains.

","We aimed to investigate the human skeletal muscle (SkM) DNA methylome after exercise in low carbohydrate (CHO) energy balance (with high fat) compared with exercise in low-CHO energy deficit (with low fat) conditions. The objective to identify novel epigenetically regulated genes and pathways associated with ‘train-low sleep-low’ paradigms. The sleep-low conditions included 9 males that cycled to deplete muscle glycogen while reaching a set energy expenditure. Post-exercise, low-CHO meals (protein-matched) completely replaced (using high-fat) or only partially replaced (low-fat) the energy expended. The following morning resting baseline biopsies were taken and the participants then undertook 75 minutes of cycling exercise, with skeletal muscle biopsies collected 30 minutes and 3.5 hours post exercise. Discovery of genome-wide DNA methylation was undertaken using Illumina EPIC arrays and targeted gene expression analysis was conducted by RT-qPCR. At baseline participants under energy balance (high fat) demonstrated a predominantly hypermethylated (60%) profile across the genome compared to energy deficit-low fat conditions. However, post exercise performed in energy balance (with high fat) elicited a more prominent hypomethylation signature 30 minutes post-exercise in gene regulatory regions important for transcription (CpG islands within promoter regions) compared with exercise in energy deficit (with low fat) conditions. Such hypomethylation was enriched within pathways related to: IL6-JAK-STAT signalling, metabolic processes, p53 / cell cycle and oxidative / fatty acid metabolism. Hypomethylation within the promoter regions of genes: HDAC2, MECR, IGF2 and c13orf16 were associated with significant increases in gene expression in the post-exercise period in energy balance compared with energy deficit. Furthermore, histone deacetylase, HDAC11 was oppositely regulated at the gene expression level compared with HDAC2, where HDAC11 was hypomethylated yet increased in energy deficit compared with energy balance conditions. Overall, we identify some novel epigenetically regulated genes associated with train-low sleep-low paradigms.","The goal of this study is to identify genes of interest through high throughput sequencing of a mouse model for BPH and compare with control, WT mice. Additionally, to use the generated RNA expression profile to compare with a previously established human microarray for BPH. Through these comparisons we hope to identify novel genes contributing to the disease in humans. Specific results of these analyses are in progress and publication content is yet to be determined.","Gene silencing by heterochromatin plays crucial roles in cell identity and development. However, the function of heterochromatin components is not fully understood. Here, we characterize the localization, the biogenesis and the function of an atypical heterochromatin, which is simultaneously enriched in the typical heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 as well as in H3K36me3, histone mark usually associated with gene expression. This dual heterochromatin forms on 3,015 regions in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells and relies on the histone methyltransferases SET Domain Bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) and Nuclear Set Domain containing proteins (NSD) to generate H3K9me3 and H3K36me3, respectively. Upon SETDB1 removal, dual domains loose both trimethyl marks, gain epigenomic signatures of active enhancers, and come into long range contact with upregulated genes, suggesting that it is a major pathway by which gene expression is controlled by heterochromatin. In differentiated tissues, a large subset of these dual domains is destabilized and become enriched in active enhancer marks, providing a mechanistic insight into the involvement of heterochromatin in development and the maintenance of cell identity.","In Drosophila, two chromosomes require special mechanisms to balance their transcriptional output to the rest of the genome. These are the male-specific lethal complex targeting the male X chromosome and Painting of fourth targeting chromosome 4. Here, we explore the role of histone H3 methylated at lysine-36 (H3K36) and the associated methyltransferases—Set2, NSD, and Ash1—in these two chromosome-specific systems. We show that the loss of Set2 impairs the MSL complex–mediated dosage compensation; however, the effect is not recapitulated by H3K36 replacement and indicates an alternative target of Set2. Unexpectedly, balanced transcriptional output from the fourth chromosome requires intact H3K36 and depends on the additive functions of NSD and Ash1. We conclude that H3K36 methylation and the associated methyltransferases are important factors to balance transcriptional output of the male X chromosome and the fourth chromosome. Furthermore, our study highlights the pleiotropic effects of these enzymes.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Chromosome 2 introgression from normotensive Brown Norway (BN) rats into hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) background (consomic S2B) reduced blood pressure (BP) and vascular inflammation under normal salt diet (NSD).

The unique N-terminal exon undegoing caspase cleavage is tagged with DsRED at its N-terminus and StrepII-Flag-StrepII upstream of caspase cleavage sites for the wild type and caspase insensitive variant versions.","Astrocytes promote neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) through cell-intrinsic activities, and also via their ability to recruit and activate other cell types. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide CRISPR-based forward genetic screen investigating regulators of astrocyte proinflammatory responses, which identified CLEC16A, a gene linked to MS susceptibility, as a suppressor of NF-B signaling. Gene and small molecule perturbation studies in mouse primary and human embryonic stem cell-derived astrocytes in combination with multi-omic analyses established that CLEC16A promotes mitophagy, limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and the accumulation of mitochondrial products that activate NF-κB, the NLRP3 inflammasome and gasdermin D. Astrocytespecific Clec16a inactivation increased NF-κB, NLRP3 and gasdermin D activation in vivo, worsening experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS. Moreover, we detected disrupted mitophagic capacity and gasdermin D activation in astrocytes in samples from individuals with MS. These findings identify CLEC16A as a suppressor of astrocyte pathologic responses and a candidate therapeutic target in MS.","Characterisation of the impact of ageing on the peripheral immune response in EAE","We used the MOG35-55 peptide induction experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis to determine whether Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition could attenuate disease-relevant changes to central nervous system gene expression.","Disruption of gut barrier function and intestinal immune cell homeostasis are increasingly considered critical players in pathogenesis of extra-intestinal inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and its prototypical animal model, theexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Breakdown of epithelial barriers increases intestinal permeability and systemic dissemination of microbiota-derived molecules. However,whetherthe gut-vascular barrier (GVB) is altered during EAE has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that endothelial cell proliferation and vessel permeability increase before EAE clinical onset, leadingto vascular remodelingand expansion of intestinal villi capillary bed during disease symptomatic phasein an antigen-independent manner. Concomitant to onset of angiogenesis observed prior to neurological symptoms, we identify an increase of intestinal perivascular immune cells characterized by the surface markerlymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor 1 (LYVE-1). LYVE-1+is expressed more frequently on B cells that show high levels of CD73 and have proangiogenic properties. B cell depletion was sufficient tomitigate enteric blood endothelial cell proliferation following immunization for EAE. In conclusion, we propose that altered intestinal vasculature driven by a specialized LYVE-1+B cell subset promotes angiogenesis and that loss of GVB function is implicated in EAE development and autoimmunity.","We used the MOG35-55 peptide induction experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis to determine whether Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition could attenuate disease-relevant changes to central nervous system gene expression.","Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most widely used rodent model for multiple sclerosis. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are individually well known to play beneficial roles in amelioration of EAE. However, little is known about the relationship between IFN-γ and Tregs during the disease. Here we show that IFN-γ polarizes Tregs into Th1-type Tregs (Th1-Tregs) to recover from EAE. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that brain Tregs showed signs of IFN-γ stimulation during EAE. Loss of IFN-γ signaling in Tregs and of T cell-derived IFN-γ impaired the Th1-Treg polarization and worsened the disease. Moreover, selective ablation of Th1-Tregs using an intersectional genetic method promoted pro-inflammatory features of macrophages in the inflamed brains and exacerbated the EAE. Taken together, our study highlights a critical role of T cell-derived IFN-γ for Th1-Treg polarization in inflamed brain to ameliorate EAE.","Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most widely used rodent model for multiple sclerosis.

Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate the mechanism of TMAO in 2VO. Bilateral common carotid artery (2VO) model was established in rats and TMAO (120 mg/kg) was administered for 8 consecutive weeks, 4 weeks preoperatively and 4 weeks postoperatively. High-throughput sequencing was performed to find out the effects of TMAO treatment on lncRNA expression in rat hippocampus and bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify potential downstream targets. Learning and spatial memory capacities were measured, as well as inflammatory factors. Nissl staining was used to observe neuronal injury in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. TMAO administration upregulated lncRNA Fendrr expression in the rat hippocampus, while the damaging effects of TMAO were counteracted after knockdown of Fendrr. Fendrr was highly expressed in 2VO rats and sponged miR-145-5p, which targets PXN. Silencing of Fendrr or PXN, or promotion of miR-145-5p improved neurological function injury, reduced neuronal damage, as well as repressed inflammation response. Inhibition of miR-145-5p abrogated up Fendrr knockdown mediated influence on 2VO rats. Taken together, our results showed that TMAO inhibits the miR-145-5p/PXN axis by increasing the Fendrr expression, thus exacerbating the development of 2VO.","In multiple sclerosis (MS), microglia and macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in determining the balance between myelin repair and demyelination/neurodegeneration. Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the critical lack of therapies promoting remyelination and slowing progression in MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, produces a shift in microglia and CNS macrophage transcriptional programs from pro-inflammatory to regenerative phenotypes, both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 stimulated scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that prevent the activation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes while promoting neuroaxonal health and oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment with bryo-1 augmented remyelination following a focal demyelinating injury in vivo. Our results demonstrate the potential of bryo-1 and possibly a wider class of PKC modulators as myelin regenerative and supportive agents in MS and other neurologic diseases through therapeutic targeting of microglia and CNS-associated macrophages.","Histone deacetylases are key epigenetic regulators that control T cell-mediated immunity. A T cell-specific deletion of Hdac1 (HDAC1cKO) protects mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it remains elusive whether inhibition of HDAC1 enzymatic activity and thus mimicking HDAC1 inhibitor treatment is sufficient to block EAE induction. In order to address this question, we generated a novel mouse strain that expresses catalytically inactive HDAC1 (HDAC1Off) from the Rosa26 locus in HDAC1cKO CD4+ T cells to mimic selective inhibition of HDAC1 enzymatic activity in vivo. Mice expressing wildtype HDAC1 in HDAC1cKO CD4+ T cells (HDAC1On) were generated as corresponding controls. In contrast to HDAC1On mice, HDAC1Off mice did not develop EAE, and this correlated with diminished leukocyte CNS infiltration. HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells in the CNS displayed a severe reduction of IFNγ, IL-17A and TNFα proinflammatory cytokine expression. In vivo activated HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells downregulated gene sets associated with T cell activation, inflammatory response and cell migration, indicating impaired effector functions of HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells. Thus, our study demonstrates that the inhibition of the catalytic activity of HDAC1 is sufficient to achieve a clinical benefit in EAE disease development. This raises the exciting translational perspective that targeting HDAC1 enzymatic activity is a promising therapeutic strategy in treating human T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.","T-cell receptor-induced Ca2+ signals are essential for proper T-cell activation and function. In this context, mitochondria play an important role and take up Ca2+ to support elevated bioenergetic demands. The protein machinery that regulates mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+) uptake; the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, could be thus implicated in T-cell immunity. However, the exact role of MCU in T-cells is not understood. Here, we show that upon activation of naïve T-cells, the MCU complex undergoes a compositional rearrangement that causes elevated mCa2+ uptake and increased bioenergetic output. Transcriptome and proteome analyses reveal molecular determinants involved in mitochondrial functional reprograming and identify signaling pathways controlled by MCU. MCUa knockdown diminishes mCa2+ uptake, mitochondrial respiration and ATP production as well as T-cell invasion and cytokine secretion. In vivo, downregulation of MCUa in rat CD4+ T-cells suppresses autoimmune responses in a multiple sclerosis model of inflammatory experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In summary, Ca2+ uptake through MCU is essential for proper T-cell function and is involved in autoimmunity. T-cell specific MCU inhibition is a potential tool for treating autoimmune disorders.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) most likely caused by autoreactive T cells. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are characterized by a semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR) with which they recognize 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU), a metabolite of the riboflavin (vitamin B2) pathway only present in yeast and bacteria. MAIT cells have been detected in inflamed brain lesions of MS patients. However, functional analyses of CNS-infiltrating MAIT cells are lacking and require a characterisation in the MS animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).","The role of HIF1a-glycolysis in regulating IFN-g induction in hypoxic T cells is unknown. Given that hypoxia is a common feature in a wide array of pathophysiological contexts such as tumor and that IFN-g is instrumental for protective immunity, it is of great significance to gain a clear idea on this. Combining pharmacological and genetic gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we find that HIF1a-glycolysis controls IFN-g induction in both human and mouse T cells activated under hypoxia. Specific deletion of HIF1a in T cells (HIF1a–/–) and glycolytic inhibition significantly abrogate IFN-g induction. Conversely, HIF1a stabilization in T cells by hypoxia and VHL deletion (VHL–/–) promotes IFN-g production. Mechanistically, reduced IFN-g production in hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells is due to attenuated activation-induced cell death but not proliferative defect. We further show that depletion of intracellular acetyl-CoA  is a key metabolic underlying mechanism. Hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells are less able to kill tumor cells, and HIF1a–/– tumor-bearing mice are not responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, indicating loss of HIF1a in T cells is a major mechanism of therapeutic resistance to ICBs. Importantly, acetate supplementation restores IFN-g production in hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells and re-sensitizes HIF1a–/– tumor-bearing mice to ICBs, providing an effective strategy to overcome ICB resistance. Taken together, our results highlight T cell HIF1a-anaerobic glycolysis as a principal mediator of IFN-g induction and anti-tumor immunity. Considering that acetate supplementation (i.e., glycerol triacetate (GTA)) is approved to treat infants with Canavan disease, we envision a rapid translation of our findings, justifying further testing of GTA as a repurposed medicine for ICB resistance, a pressing unmet medical need","Omics analyses and qRT-PCR time-course during the transition from hiPSC to hiPSC-NSC highlighted the up-regulation of SREBF1, a gene involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid homeostasis, suggesting its potential role in NSC commitment/maintenance. To test this hypothesis, we generated SREBF1-deficient hiPSC lines by co-delivering ribonucleoprotein Cas9 with a pool of sgRNA targeting exon 5 of the SREBF1 gene. Upon isolation of three clones harboring the deletion we performed RNA-seq analysis in hiPSC, hiPSC-NSC and differentiated cultures at 7 and 14 days of differentiation, compared to control cells. This analysis will allow to identify the potential role of SREBF1 in affecting hiPSC-to-hiPSC-NSC transition, hiPSC-NSC maintenance and commitment toward differentiated cell populations.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Reactive astrocytes play critical roles in the occurrence of various neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Activation of astrocytes is often accompanied by a glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch. We found that PKM2 displayed nuclear translocation in astrocytes of EAE mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. And we identified the ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear import by ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. To detect the expression of TRM21 in EAE mice, We used single-cell sequencing to analyze the expression  of TRM21 in EAE mice.","Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare X-linked neurogenetic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and severity of ALD still remain unclear. For mining information on candidate genes associated with onset and severity of ALD, RNA-seq had been executed via using whole blood samples from monozygotic twin families with ALD disease. The information on candidate genes of this research had been considered as the crucial for preliminarily exploring the molecular mechanisms relating to the onset and severity of ALD, which offered novel insights and research directions for mitigating and treating the development of ALD.","Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3) has emerged as the next-generation immune checkpoint molecule due to its ability to inhibit effector T cell activity. Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, a master regulator of immunity and tolerance, also highly express Lag3. While Lag3 is thought to be necessary for Treg cell-mediated regulation of immunity, the precise roles and underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. In this study, we report that Lag3 is indispensable for Treg cells to control autoimmune inflammation. Utilizing a newly generated Treg cell specific Lag3 mutant mouse model, we found that these animals are highly susceptible to autoimmune diseases, suggesting defective Treg cell function. Genome wide transcriptome analysis further uncovered that Lag3 mutant Treg cells upregulated genes involved in metabolic processes. Mechanistically, we found that Lag3 limits Treg cell expression of Myc, a key regulator of aerobic glycolysis. We further found that Lag3-dependent Myc expression determines Treg cells’ metabolic programming as well as the in vivo function to suppress autoimmune inflammation. Taken together, our results uncovered a novel function of Lag3 in supporting Treg cell suppressive function by regulating Myc-dependent metabolic programming.","Microglia are considered as a heterogenous population in the brain tissues. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the diversity of microglia in the rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.","Aged patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have more progressive and severe symptoms, even though aged people have increased frequency of peripheral Treg (pTreg) cells which inhibit this disease. Our goal is to how aged pTreg cells with changes in their frequency and functionality contribute to increased severity of late-onset MS using mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). For this purpose, we reported the Treg cell plasticities and T cell clonalities in the CNS infiltrated T cells in the late-onset EAE mouse model.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Assessing the dynamics of chromatin and transcription factor (TF) DNA binding in plants remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the lack of efficient tools for capturing these features on a larger scale. Here, we present PHILO (Plant HIgh-throughput LOw input) ChIP-seq, a high-throughput ChIP-seq platform that enables the cost-effective and extensive capture of TF DNA binding and the genome-wide distribution of histone modifications. Through the application of H3K9ac PHILO ChIP-seq to eight jasmonic acid pathway mutants, involving the parallel processing of over 100 samples, we not only substantially corroborate the previously described interplay among chromatin regulators at the target genes of the JA master TF MYC2 but also unveil previously unknown histone acetylation patterns in the regulatory regions of MYC2 target genes. Overall, our PHILO ChIP-seq platform proves to be a highly effective approach for simultaneously examining chromatin on an unprecedented scale opening the door to conducting large-scale epigenome studies in plants.","Low frequency Jak2VF mutations promote atherosclerosis via IL-1 mediated cross-talk. Therapeutic approaches that increase MERTK or TREM2 could promote plaque stabilization in inflammasome-driven atherosclerosis.","Background &amp; Aims: Liver macrophages are heterogeneous and play an important role in alcohol_x0002_associated liver disease (ALD) but there is limited understanding of the functions of specific macrophage subsets in the disease. We used a Western Diet Alcohol (WDA) mouse model of ALD to examine the hepatic myeloid cell compartment by scRNA seq and targeted Kupffer cell (KC) ablation to understand the diversity and function of liver macrophages in ALD. Approach and Results: In the WDA liver, KCs and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (IMs) each represented about 50% of the myeloid pool. Five major KC clusters all expressed genes associated with receptor mediated endocytosis and lipid metabolism, but most were predicted to be non_x0002_inflammatory and antifibrotic with one minor KC cluster having a pro-inflammatory and extracellular matrix degradation gene signature. IM clusters, in contrast, were predicted to be pro_x0002_inflammatory and pro-fibrotic. In vivo diphtheria toxin based selective KC ablation during alcohol exposure resulted in a liver failure phenotype with increases in PT/INR and bilirubin, loss of differentiated hepatocyte gene expression, and an increase in expression of hepatocyte progenitor markers such as EpCAM, CK-7 and Igf2bp3. Gene set enrichment analysis of whole liver RNAseq from the KC ablated WDA mice showed a similar pattern as seen in human alcoholic hepatitis. Conclusions: In this ALD model, KCs are anti-inflammatory and are critical for maintenance of hepatocyte differentiation. IMs are largely pro-inflammatory and contribute more to liver fibrosis. Future targeting of specific macrophage subsets may provide new approaches to treatment of liver failure and fibrosis in ALD.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The purpose of this experiment is to characterize changes in the transcriptome and epigenome in diet-associated liver cancer.

We performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of hippocampus of two WT mice fed a WD (WT-WD) and two KO-WD mice.","The liver contains a diverse array of immune cells that play distinct roles in both health and disease. However, the specific functions of these immune cells in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood. Using a systems immunology approach, we demonstrate that reciprocal cell-cell communication operates through a dominant-subdominant pattern of ligand-receptor homeostatic pathways. In healthy controls, inflammatory immune responses predominantly function through these homeostatic pathways, indicating that the liver is not a tolerogenic organ. Chronic consumption of a Western diet (WD) altered hepatocyte function and led to interactions dominated by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), cancer cells, and NKT cells, with 80% of NKT cells becoming the primary immune cells involved in liver homeostasis during NAFLD. In the context of HCC, 80% of all immune cell types, primarily NKT cells and monocytes, collaborated with hepatocytes and myofibroblasts to restore liver homeostasis. Dietary correction during NAFLD produced nonlinear outcomes: tumor progression was associated with the failure to maintain homeostatic immune responses, while tumor prevention correlated with sustained homeostatic immune responses predominantly driven by monocytes. These monocytes primarily targeted fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, creating a tumor-hostile microenvironment. Notably, only 5% of T cells exhibited apoptosis-inducing functions, primarily facilitating the homeostatic turnover of hepatic cells, particularly myofibroblasts and fibroblasts. Our data suggest that effective anti-tumor immune responses operate as a system through tissue homeostatic pathways that modulate the hepatic microenvironment, rather than relying solely on direct cytotoxicity against the tumor.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","A single enzyme, TGM2, bidirectionally controls H3 monoaminylation dynamics, which, in turn, facilitate neural rhythmicity","The WD repeat-containing protein 4 (WDR4) has repeatedly been associated with primary microcephaly, a condition of impaired brain and skull growth, which may be due to faulty cilia. Here, we show using a combination of approaches in human fibroblasts, zebrafish embryos and patient-derived cells that WDR4 facilitates cilium formation. Molecularly, we associated WDR4 loss-of-function with increased protein synthesis and concomitant upregulation of proteasomal activity, while ubiquitin precursor pools are reduced. Inhibition of proteasomal activity as well as supplementation with free ubiquitin restored normal ciliogenesis. Proteasome inhibition ameliorated microcephaly phenotypes. Thus, we propose that WDR4 loss-of-function impairs head growth and neurogenesis via aberrant cilia formation, initially caused by disturbed protein and ubiquitin homeostasis.","Soil water deficit (WD) is one of the most important abiotic stresses affecting plant survival and crop yield. Despite its economic relevance, many gaps remain in our understanding of how crops respond to WD, especially concerning the synergistic coordination of molecular and ecophysiological adaptations delaying plant mortality. In this study, we investigated the gene expression imposed by a progressive WD and combined it with measurements pointing to key ecophysiological thresholds in leaves of tomato plants. We uncovered the transcriptomic changes in mature leaves at four stages defined by physiological markers relating to different WD intensities: partial stomatal closure, complete stomatal closure, after leaf wilting, and beginning of embolism development in the veins. By identifying key transcription factors (TFs) across these progressively worsening WD stages, we investigated the timing and impact of ABA-(in)dependent gene regulatory pathways during WD. In addition, we compared the transcriptome in young developing versus mature leaves and explored the physiological mechanisms that may explain the higher tolerance to dehydration in younger leaves. By correlating the transcriptomic changes to precise ecophysiological measurements, the combined dataset will serve as a framework for future studies comparing leaf molecular and physiological responses to WD at specific intensities.","Recent findings reveal the importance of tryptophan-initiated de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis in the liver, a process previously considered secondary to biosynthesis from nicotinamide. Here we show that inhibiting α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) promotes de novo NAD+ synthesis and reduces DNA damage ex vivo, in vivo and in human liver organoid (HLO) models. In mouse models of MASLD/MASH, de novo NAD+ biosynthesis is suppressed, and transcriptomic DNA damage signatures correlate with disease severity; In humans, Mendelian randomization-based genetic analysis suggests a notable impact of genomic stress on liver disease susceptibility. Therapeutic inhibiting ACMSD in mice elevates liver NAD+ and reverses MASLD/MASH, mitigating fibrosis, inflammation and DNA damage. Similar outcomes are recapitulated in HLO models of steatohepatitis and DNA damage. Our findings highlight the benefits of ACMSD inhibition for boosting hepatic NAD+ and genomic protection, indicating its therapeutic promise in liver diseases marked by NAD+ and genomic stress.","We explored the hypothesis that gene expression will be dysregulated in the liver of low birth weight (LBW) offspring, distinct from normal birth weight (NBW) offspring, in young adulthood when both birth weight outcomes are challenged with a lifelong postnatal Western diet (WD). Independent of diet, in LBW vs. NBW males, 7 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, most of which downregulated (5 vs. 2) in LBW males. A similar trend was observed in LBW vs. NBW females, where 12 DEGs were identified, predominantly downregulated in the LBW group (9 vs. 3), irrespective of diet. Lifelong WD consumption exerted a marked influence on liver transcription profiles. Notably, 553 (444 upregulated and 109 downregulated) and 639 (533 upregulated and 106 downregulated) DEGs were identified in males and females, independent of birth weight, respectively. Additionally, in females, birth weight and WD both impacted six genes. Further, transcriptomic analysis revealed 22 (9 upregulated and 13 downregulated) and 55 (12 upregulated and 43 downregulated) DEGs between LBW/WD and NBW/WD groups in males and females, respectively.","Ocular injuries and visual deterioration occur in a large percentage of Warfighters sustaining physical and psychological trauma. From 2000 through the end of 2017, more than 275,000 Service-members have suffered from eye injuries, as shown by Surveillance data from the Department of Defense (DOD). Exposure to blast overpressure (BOP) also directly affects the brain visual signal processing centers (e.g., optic tracts). Likewise, traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced impairments of vision are commonly seen among Military Veterans even when there is no direct injury to the eye, e.g., retina. Hence, these traumatic insults can influence the regulation of the visual and nonvisual retinal signaling pathways. The ocular system could be directly injured or could degenerate secondary to injury induced by psychological stress. Despite the lifelong disservice that vision losses exhibit, there are only few studies demonstrating the effect of these insults on retinal transcriptomics and the signaling mechanisms underlying the eye damage. Studies have shown that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the most abundant ω-3 PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) in the central nervous system and especially the retina and plays an important role in neuronal membrane structure integrity and neural dendritic connectivity. Hence, inclusion of ω-3s as dietary supplements could possibly be a vital therapeutic approach in alleviating stress-related ocular impairments. The objective of this study is to study the role of essential nutrients i.e., dietary ω-3 fatty acids on the ocular vulnerability to TBI and psychological stress. The retina was collected at 14 days post-insult, and gene expression changes were assessed by analyzing extracted total RNA on whole rat genome microarrays. Our findings in rats showed that TBI exposure significantly impaired the expression of retinal genes in all the diet groups, with highest change observed in the ω-3 rich house chow (HC) group. Psychological stress had a greater effect on retinal gene expression, particularly in rats fed with ω-3 deficient 1% LA diet (2249 genes downregulated and 1256 genes upregulated). The network clusters like neurovascular coupling and synaptic signaling were affected by TBI in ω-3 rich HC diet group while chemokine and actin cytoskeleton signaling were shown to be disrupted in ω-3 deficient 8% LA diet. Together, the results showed that these two diets (i.e., house chow and 8% LA) had opposing effects on some of the signaling pathways including endocannabinoid pathway and neuronal plasticity. For the UWT (underwater trauma) study, exposure to psychological stress significantly altered CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and opioid signaling in rodents fed with ω-3 deficient diets (i.e., 8% LA and 1% LA). Additionally, ephrin receptor and calcium signaling were differentially regulated by psychological stress in 1% LA versus 8% LA diet. Overall, the findings of our study suggest that poor dietary conditions can greatly influence the resilience to TBI and psychological stress. This work was intramurally funded by the USAMRDC/MOMRP.","To investigate expression changes of the KO vs. control livers under 3 months of Western Diet. We then performed mRNA seq analysis on MOSAICS based single-gene whole-liver KO samples and control samples","Macrophages are considered as a homogeneous population in the heart. We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze thediversity of macrophages in control diet (CD) mouse,  high fat diet (HFD) mouse and Western diet (WD) mouse heart.","Early cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) show epithelial differentiation features and good prognosis, whereas advanced cSCCs present mesenchymal traits and are associated with tumor relapse, metastasis, and poor survival. Prognostic biomarkers for cSCC relapse must therefore be found that accurately predict the clinical course of the disease, since established markers are suboptimal. Using mouse models of cSCC progression, we showed that the emergence of epithelial plastic cancer cells with a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype promotes tumor progression to a mesenchymal state. These cells can be identified early on by the expression of integrin αV (ITGAV). Analysis of ITGAV expression in a cohort of primary cSCCs from patients provided prognostic information about the risk of relapse beyond current histopathological parameters. Together, our findings provide an opportunity to clinically implement ITGAV by standard immunodetection approaches and thereby improve patient stratification and therapeutic management.","While macrophage heterogeneity during Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has been described, the fate of these macrophages during MASH regression is poorly understood. Comparing macrophage heterogeneity during MASH progression vs regression, we identified specific macrophage sub- populations that are critical for MASH/fibrosis resolution. We elucidated the restorative pathways and gene signatures that define regression associated macrophages (RAM) and establish the importance of TREM2+ macrophages during MASH regression. Liver resident Kupffer cells are lost during MASH and are replaced by four distinct monocyte derived macrophage sub-populations. Trem2 is expressed in two macrophage sub- populations: (i) monocyte-derived macrophages occupying the Kupffer cell niche (MoKC) and (ii) lipid-associated macrophages (LAM). In regression livers, no new transcriptionally distinct MF sub-population emerged. However, the relative macrophage composition changed during regression compared to MASH. While MoKC was the major macrophage sub-population during MASH, they decreased during regression. LAM was the dominant macrophage sub-type during MASH regression and maintained Trem2 expression. Both MoKC and LAM were enriched in disease resolving pathways. Absence of TREM2 restricted the emergence of LAMs and formation of hepatic crown like structures (hCLS). TREM2+ macrophages are functionally important not only for restricting MASH-fibrosis progression, but also for effective regression of inflammation and fibrosis. TREM2+ MF are superior collagen degraders. Lack of TREM2+ macrophages also prevented elimination of hepatic steatosis and inactivation of HSC during regression, indicating their significance in metabolic co-ordination with other cell- types in the liver. TREM2 imparts this protective effect through multifactorial mechanisms, including improved phagocytosis, lipid-handling and collagen degradation.","Background: Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is the clinical manifestation of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). AH is a complex disease encompassing the dysregulation of many cells and cell subpopulations. This study used a hepatic spatial transcriptomic and proteomic approach (10X Genomics Visium) to identify hepatic cell populations and their associated transcriptomic and proteomic alterations in human AH. Methods: Formalin fixed parraffin embedded liver tissue from AH patients (n=2) and non-ALD controls (donors) (n=2) were used for Visium spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Results: AH cell clusters and cell markers were drastically different in regard to tissue pattern and number of cell type as compared to non-ALD controls. Cholangiocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, and stellate cells were more profuse in AH relative to non-ALD controls. Transcriptionally, proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive (PCNA+) hepatocytes in AH more closely resembled cholangiocytes suggesting they were non-functional hepatocytes derived from cholangiocytes. Further, mitochondria protein coding genes were reduced in AH vs non-ALD control hepatocytes, suggesting reduced functionality and loss of regenerative mechanisms. Macrophages in AH exhibited elevated gene expression involved in exosomes as compared to non-ALD controls. The most upregulated macrophage genes observed in AH were those involved in exosome trafficking and cellular migration. Gene and protein signatures of disease associated hepatocytes (ANXA2+/CXCL1+/CEACAM8+) were elevated in AH and could visually identify a pre-malignant lesion. Conclusions: This study identified global cell type alterations in AH and distinct transcriptomic changes between AH and non-ALD controls. These findings characterizes cellular plasticity and profuse transcriptomic and proteomic changes that are apparent in AH and contributes to the identification of novel therapeutics.","We show that GR co-expression alters MR genome-wide binding and transcriptional activity in a locus and ligand specific way.","Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) results from excessive alcohol consumption and is more severe in females. The prenane X receptor (PXR), a xenobiotic nuclear receptor essential for toxin defense, has been implicated in ALD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Due to species differences in ligand specificty, humanized PXR (hPXR) mouse models are necessary to investigate its role in the sexual dimorphism of ALD in humans. Ethanol exposure caused the most severe hepatoxicity in female hPXR mice with microarray analysis identifying 442 genes uniquely regulated by ethanol in female hPXR mice, implicated with ethanol-induced liver damage.","Background &amp; Aims: Liver macrophages are heterogeneous and play an important role in alcohol_x0002_associated liver disease (ALD) but there is limited understanding of the functions of specific macrophage subsets in the disease. We used a Western Diet Alcohol (WDA) mouse model of ALD to examine the hepatic myeloid cell compartment by scRNA seq and targeted Kupffer cell (KC) ablation to understand the diversity and function of liver macrophages in ALD. Approach and Results: In the WDA liver, KCs and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (IMs) each represented about 50% of the myeloid pool. Five major KC clusters all expressed genes associated with receptor mediated endocytosis and lipid metabolism, but most were predicted to be non_x0002_inflammatory and antifibrotic with one minor KC cluster having a pro-inflammatory and extracellular matrix degradation gene signature. IM clusters, in contrast, were predicted to be pro_x0002_inflammatory and pro-fibrotic. In vivo diphtheria toxin based selective KC ablation during alcohol exposure resulted in a liver failure phenotype with increases in PT/INR and bilirubin, loss of differentiated hepatocyte gene expression, and an increase in expression of hepatocyte progenitor markers such as EpCAM, CK-7 and Igf2bp3. Gene set enrichment analysis of whole liver RNAseq from the KC ablated WDA mice showed a similar pattern as seen in human alcoholic hepatitis. Conclusions: In this ALD model, KCs are anti-inflammatory and are critical for maintenance of hepatocyte differentiation. IMs are largely pro-inflammatory and contribute more to liver fibrosis. Future targeting of specific macrophage subsets may provide new approaches to treatment of liver failure and fibrosis in ALD.","Background &amp; Aims: Liver macrophages are heterogeneous and play an important role in alcohol_x0002_associated liver disease (ALD) but there is limited understanding of the functions of specific macrophage subsets in the disease.

However, fibrosis improvement after cessation is not uniform and some patients do not improve. We aimed to use scATAC-seq analysis in a mouse model of ALD to define the mechanism of poor ALD resolution. We analyzed differentially accessible regions in livers from control, ALD, or 4 weeks post alcohol cessation mice and identified transcription factors activated in ALD that remained activated after alcohol withdrawal. The top hit was C/EBPβ. We found that hepatocyte specific Cebpb knockout prevented ALD development, while knockout at the time of alcohol cessation promoted fibrosis resolution.","Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare X-linked neurogenetic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and severity of ALD still remain unclear. For mining information on candidate genes associated with onset and severity of ALD, RNA-seq had been executed via using whole blood samples from monozygotic twin families with ALD disease. The information on candidate genes of this research had been considered as the crucial for preliminarily exploring the molecular mechanisms relating to the onset and severity of ALD, which offered novel insights and research directions for mitigating and treating the development of ALD.","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a kind of liver disease that will result in liver cancer and some other high death rate liver disease. The study results show that riboflavin could protect the mouse against ALD. Then the study divides the C57BL/6 mice into the three groups including Control (C), Alcohol, Alcohol with riboflavin (AR) groups respectively. And the study makes the mouse stool samples 16S RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to find the  differential itestinal microbiota homeostasis among three groups futher and does the related analysis in riboflavin-treated alcoholic liver disease.","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a kind serious liver disease, which will develope into the cirrhosis, liver cancer and so on.

And the study makes the mouse liver RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to find the  differential expression mRNAs among three groups futher and does the related analysis in riboflavin-treated alcoholic liver disease.","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the most prevalent types of liver disease associated with high morbidity and mortality, caused by hepatotoxicity originating from alcohol metabolism, but current therapeutic drugs are still limited. The role of ACSS2 as an enzyme that metabolizes acetate in ALD remains unknown. Our study aimed to investigate the function of ACSS2 and its potential mechanism in ALD progression.","Peroxisome Biogenesis disorders (PBDs) represent a group of metabolic conditions that cause severe developmental defects. Peroxisomes are essential metabolic organelles, present in virtually every eukaryotic cell and mediating key processes in immunometabolism. To date, the full spectrum of PBDs remains to be identified, and the impact PBDs have on immune function is unexplored. This study presents a characterization of the hepatic immune compartment of a neonatal PBD mouse model at single-cell resolution to establish the importance and function of peroxisomes in developmental hematopoiesis. We report that hematopoietic defects are a feature in a severe PBD murine model. Finally, we identify a role for peroxisomes in the regulation of the major histocompatibility class II expression and antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells in dendritic cells. This study adds to our understanding of the mechanisms of PBDs and expands our knowledge of the role of peroxisomes in immunometabolism.","Pharmacological activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) is a convenient and promising tactic for promoting beige adipocyte biogenesis to combat obesity-related metabolic disorders. However, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), the full agonist of PPAR-γ exhibits severe side effects in animal model and clinical uses. Therefore, it is emerging to develop efficient and safe PPAR-γ modulators for metabolic disease treatment. Here, by utilizing comprehensive methods, we report a previously unidentified ligand binding pocket (LBP) in PPAR-γ and link it to beige adipocyte differentiation. Further virtual screening from 4097 natural compounds based on this novel LBP, we discover NJT-2, a terpenoid compound, can bind to PPAR-γ induce co-activator recruitment and effectively activate PPAR-γ mediated transcription of beige adipocyte program. Importantly, in mouse model, NJT-2 administration efficiently promotes beige adipocyte biogenesis and improve obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction with significant lower adverse effects than those observed in TZD. Our results not only provide an advanced molecular insight into the structural ligand binding details in PPARg, but also develop its linked selective and safe agonist for obesity treatment.","Although most known mycoviruses are asymptomatic or reduce the virulence of their host fungi, those that confer hypervirulence to entomopathogenic fungus still need to be explored. Here, we discovered and studied a novel mycovirus in Metarhizium flavoviride, isolated from Laodelphax striatellus. Based on molecular analysis, we tentatively designated the mycovirus as Metarhizium flavoviride partitivirus 1 (MfPV1), a novel species in genus Gammapartitivirus, family Partitiviridae. MfPV1 has two double-stranded (ds) RNAs as its genome, 1,775 and 1,575 bp in size respectively, encapsidated in isometric particles. When we transfected commercial strains of M. anisopliae and M. pingshaense with MfPV1, conidiation was significantly enhanced (t-test; P-value &lt; 0. 01), and the significantly higher mortality rates of the larvae of Plutella xylostella and Spodoptera frugiperda, two important lepidopteran pests were found in virus-transfected strains (ANOVA; P-value &lt; 0.05). Transcriptomic analysis showed that transcript levels of pathogenesis-related genes in MfPV1-infected M. anisopliae were obviously altered, suggesting increased production of metarhizium adhesin-like protein, hydrolyzed protein and destruxin synthetase. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism whereby MfPV1 enhances the expression of pathogenesis-related genes and virulence of Metarhizium to lepidopteran pests. This study presents experimental evidence that the transfection of other entomopathogenic fungal species with a mycovirus can confer significant hypervirulence and provides a good example that mycoviruses could be used as synergistic agent to enhance the biocontrol activity of entomopathogenic fungi.","Our study elucidates the broad-spectrum effects of proteasome hyperactivation on the proteome, demonstrating its substantial influence on the proteostasis network. Through comprehensive analyses, we identified a significant reorganization of the transcriptome, enhanced mRNA processing, and increased translation activity. The study further reveals the hyperactivation's impact on intrinsically disordered proteins, lipid synthesis, and biogenesis, evidenced by major changes in lipid droplets and peroxisome proliferation. Notably, we uncovered protective phenotypes against oxidative stress, primarily mediated by Super Oxide Dismutases (SODs), indicating an elevated stress response readiness. Additionally, our research highlighted the hyperactive proteasome's selective targeting of vitellogenins, crucial for lipid metabolism and implicated in the aging process of C. elegans. Enhanced ERAD-dependent degradation was observed, facilitating the clearance of senescent VIT-2 protein aggregates and promoting healthier aging. The α3ΔN mutant significantly reduced the quantity of human alpha-1 antitrypsin (ATZ) aggregates and delayed their formation in a C. elegans model for ATZ disease, suggesting its potential as an ERAD enhancer. These findings propose proteasome hyperactivation as a promising strategy for treating aggregation-prone diseases, offering novel avenues for drug development and therapeutic interventions against neurodegeneration.","Background: Environmental pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been shown to alter and promote the development of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Our group recently demonstrated that PCB126 promoted steatosis, hepatomegaly, and modulated intermediary metabolism in an ALD rodent model. Objectives: To better understand how PCB126 promoted ALD, the current study adopts transcriptomic and metallomic approaches to identify mechanistic pathways involved in this promotion. Methods: Briefly, male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 0.2 mg/kg PCB126 or corn oil vehicle prior to ethanol feeding in the chronic-binge model. Liver tissues were collected for RNA sequencing and ICP-MS metals quantification. Results: PCB126 uniquely modified the transcriptome in EtOH-fed mice in terms of variance. EtOH feeding alone resulting in &gt;4000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and PCB126 exposure resulted in more DEGs in the EtOH-fed group over the pair-fed group. Top gene ontology (GO) biological processes indicated ‘peptidyl tyrosine modifications’ and GO molecular function processes showed a loss of ‘metal, and ion, and zinc binding’. Western blot analysis depicted that the JAK2-STAT5 signaling axis was disrupted by the enhanced loss of phosphorylated JAK2 in EtOH+PCB126 mice. Quantified liver essential metal levels were overall depleted by EtOH feeding, and potassium, magnesium, cobalt, and zinc were further decreased by PCB126. Discussion: The results suggests that phosphorylation and metal binding are disrupted in EtOH+PCB126 mice, implying that evolutionarily conserved homeostatic signaling mechanisms are modified by pollutant exposure in EtOH-fed mice. The loss of phosphorylation and essential metals are two suggestive modes of action that may explain the promotion of disease by PCB126 in ALD.","Since oxidative stress plays a major role in liver fibrosis and induces post-translational modifications of proteins, we hypothesized that redox-sensitive HMGB1 isoforms contribute to liver fibrosis progression and resolution. This study is significant because a rise in [H] HMGB1 could flag 'patient at risk', the presence of [O] HMGB1 could suggest 'disease in progress or active scarring', while the appearance of [SO3] HMGB1 could point at 'resolution under way'. The latter could be used as a readout for response to pharmacological intervention with anti-fibrotic agents.","In X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), the most common peroxisomal disorder, microglial defect is suggested to prime and amplify the neuroinflammatory process. By using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we recently established BV-2 microglial cell models to study the impact of dysfunctional peroxisomal b-oxidation and demonstrated the emergence of a disease-associated microglial signature in these cell lines. Their transcriptomic analysis suggested consequences on immune response. To go further, we have used RNA-sequencing and functional assays related to immune response to compare the WT and mutant BV-2 cell lines in basal conditions or upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.","Background &amp; Aims: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is associated with loss of vitamin A (retinoids), increased steatosis, and greater oxidative stress. Although a strong correlation has been observed between loss of retinoids and ALD, if retinoid loss plays a causal role in the pathophysiology of ALD is not clear. Approach &amp; Results: Based on our prior published data indicating that a selective retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ) agonist limits nonalcohol-related liver disease (NAFLD) pathology, we generated AlbCre;RARβ knockout (BKO) mice and fed these mice a Lieber DeCarli ethanol diet (ETOH). We also generated cultured human hepatocytes (HepG2) that lack RARβ (RARβ-KO) and treated them with ETOH.        Here we show that the livers of BKO mice develop greater steatosis, oxidative stress (assessed by 4-HNE), cell proliferation, and hypertrophy on the ETOH diet when compared to wild type (WT). Compared to ETOH-WT mice, the ETOH-BKO mice also exhibit higher hepatic transcript levels of ATF4, MYC, a subset of integrated stress response (ISR) genes (Trib3, Asns, Nqo1, and Hmox1), and the common ATF4 and MYC target, 4EBP1(EIF4EBP1). In RARβ-KO HepG2 cells, ETOH treatments (24 and 72h) resulted in more rapid and greater development of reactive oxygen species compared to parental HepG2. Notably, even without ETOH, ATF4 protein was higher in the RARβ-KO than in parental HepG2. Conclusions: Our research identifies hepatocyte RARβ as a crucial negative regulator of oxidative stress, MYC, ATF4, and proliferation in ALD.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of alcohol related mortality. Recently we identified hepatic demethylases KDM5B and KDM5C as important sex-specific epigenetic regulators of alcohol response in the liver. In this study we aimed to study the molecular mechanisms of KDM5-dependent ALD development and resolution. We found that alcohol induces pathological changes in cell-cell communication in the liver that are in part mediated by epigenetic changes in hepatocytes mediated by histone demethylase KDM5B.  Using cell type specific knockout mice, we found that KDM5B histone demethylase was a key regulator of alcohol-induced epigenetic changes in hepatocytes. Moreover, it regulated hepatocytes-non-parenchymal cell crosstalk that promoted inflammation and fibrosis development in ALD. This mechanism was specific to females. In males KDM5B deficiency was not sufficient to prevent fibrosis development. In contrast KDM5B demethylase loss promoted fibrosis resolution in both males and females. This mechanism involved changes in hepatocyte-macrophage crosstalk and LXRα activation, which we identified to be critical for the fibrosis resolution process. CONCLUSION: In summary, KDM5B demethylase is a regulator of cell-cell crosstalk involved in disease progression in females and in disease resolution in both sexes.","We recently identified a gene module of 87 genes co-expressed with MCL1 (MCL1-M), a critical regulator of plasma cell survival. MCL1-M captures both MM cell-intrinsically acting signals and the signals regulating the interaction between MM cells with bone marrow microenvironment. MM can be clustered into MCL1-M high and MCL1-M low subtypes. While the MCL1-M high MMs are enriched in a preplasmablast signature, the MCL1-M low MMs are enriched in B cell-specific genes. In multiple independent datasets, MCL1-M high MMs exhibited poorer prognosis compared to MCL1-M low MMs. Re-analysis of the phase III HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 showed that only MCL1-M MMs, but not MCL1-M low MMs, benefited from bortezomib-based treatment. To translate the MCL1-M clustering scheme into a platform for individual diagnosis, we refined the classifier genes and developed a support vector machine-based algorithm. Individual MMs with transcriptome assessed at the RNA-seq or U133 plus 2.0 array platform can be robustly assigned as the MCL1-M high or low subtype with high confidence. Analyses of the MM samples in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial and APEX trial reinforce that only MCL1-M high MMs benefit from bortezomib-based treatment with a hazard ratio of 0.58 (P = 0.010) and 0.47 (P = 0.009), respectively. Thus, MCL1-M based subtyping assigns MMs into prognostic and predictive molecular subtypes driven by subtype-specific pathogenic pathways.","To understand the dynamics and global gene reprogramming in the early response to mechanical wounding in rice, the transcriptional response to mechanical injury was analyzed. A time-course experiment revealed the highly dynamic nature of the wound response in rice. Mechanical wounding triggered extensive gene expression reprogramming in the locally wounded leaf, affecting various physiological processes, including defense mechanisms and potentially tissue repair and regeneration. The rice response to mechanical wounding displayed both differences and similarities compared to the response to jasmonate treatment. These results highlight the importance of early JA signaling in response to mechanical stress in rice. This analysis provides an overview of the global transcriptional response to mechanical stress in rice, offering valuable insights for future studies on rice's response to injury, insect attack, and abiotic stresses.","Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) constitute a group of clinically and genetically diverse vision-impairing disorders. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common form of IRD, is characterized by gradual dysfunction and degeneration of rod photoreceptors, followed by the loss of cone photoreceptors. Recently, we identified reserpine as a lead molecule for maintaining rod survival in mouse and human retinal organoids as well as in the rd16 mouse, which phenocopy Leber congenital amaurosis caused by mutations in the cilia-centrosomal gene CEP290 (Chen et al. eLife 2023;12:e83205. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83205). Here, we show the therapeutic potential of reserpine in a rhodopsin P23H rat model of autosomal dominant RP. At postnatal day (P) 68, when males and females are analyzed together, the reserpine-treated rats exhibit higher rod-derived scotopic b-wave amplitudes compared to the controls with little or no change in scotopic a-wave or cone-derived photopic b-wave. Interestingly, the reserpine-treated female rats display enhanced scotopic a- and b-waves and photopic b-wave responses at P68, along with a better contrast threshold and increased outer nuclear layer thickness. The female rats demonstrate better preservation of both rod and cone photoreceptors following reserpine treatment. Retinal transcriptome analysis reveals sex-specific responses to reserpine, with significant upregulation of phototransduction genes and proteostasis-related pathways, and notably, genes associated with stress response. This study builds upon our previously reported results reaffirming the potential of reserpine for gene-agnostic treatment of IRDs and emphasizes the importance of biological sex in retinal disease research and therapy development.","Jasmonate is an essential phytohormone involved in plant development and stress responses. Jasmonate perception occurs through the COI nuclear receptor allowing to target the JAZs repressors for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Consequently, repressed transcription factors are released and expression of JA-responsive genes is induced. In rice, three OsCOI genes have been identified, OsCOI1a and the closely related OsCOI1b homolog, and OsCOI2. While a role for OsCOI-1a and -1b genes was previously established in plant defense or leaf senescence, evidence for an important role of OsCOI2 in plant development, jasmonate-signaling and defence emerged only recently. To decipher the role of OsCOI2 in regulating jasmonate responses, we used rice mutant lines, edited both in the OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b genes, or in the OsCOI2 gene. Rice roots from WT and oscoi lines were treated by jasmonate to establish the molecular responses of each line, at the transcriptomic and metabolomic levels. RNA-seq data indicate that OsCOI2 is the main actor of the large transcriptional reprogramming observed after a JA challenge in rice roots. A series of transcription factors with an OsCOI2-dependent expression was identified, including transcription factors known to have a role in root development or stress response. An OsCOI2-dependent expression was detected for genes involved in specific processes or pathways such as photosynthesis, cell-growth and secondary metabolite biosynthesis (phenylpropanoids and diterpene phytoalexins). Functional redundancy between OsCOI1a/b and OsCOI2 can be shown for some genes, even if a lower response usually occurred in oscoi2 plants compared to oscoi1ab plants. Metabolic data revealed a shift from the primary metabolism to the secondary metabolism that is mainly OsCOI2-dependent. Differential accumulation of oryzalexins was also observed in oscoi lines.These data validate the major role of OsCOI2 in JA responses in rice roots. OsCOI2 is the major regulator of specialized metabolic pathways related to development and production of secondary metabolites. This study suggests that OsCOI2 controls the growth-defense trade-off in response to JA.","Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare X-linked neurogenetic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and severity of ALD still remain unclear. For mining information on candidate genes associated with onset and severity of ALD, RNA-seq had been executed via using whole blood samples from monozygotic twin families with ALD disease. The information on candidate genes of this research had been considered as the crucial for preliminarily exploring the molecular mechanisms relating to the onset and severity of ALD, which offered novel insights and research directions for mitigating and treating the development of ALD.","Peroxisome Biogenesis disorders (PBDs) represent a group of metabolic conditions that cause severe developmental defects. Peroxisomes are essential metabolic organelles, present in virtually every eukaryotic cell and mediating key processes in immunometabolism. To date, the full spectrum of PBDs remains to be identified, and the impact PBDs have on immune function is unexplored. This study presents a characterization of the hepatic immune compartment of a neonatal PBD mouse model at single-cell resolution to establish the importance and function of peroxisomes in developmental hematopoiesis. We report that hematopoietic defects are a feature in a severe PBD murine model. Finally, we identify a role for peroxisomes in the regulation of the major histocompatibility class II expression and antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells in dendritic cells. This study adds to our understanding of the mechanisms of PBDs and expands our knowledge of the role of peroxisomes in immunometabolism.","Vision depends on the functional interplay between the photoreceptor cells of the neural retina and the supporting cells of the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Many genes involved in inherited retinal diseases (IRD) display highly specific spatiotemporal expression within these interconnected retinal components through the local recruitment of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in 3D nuclear space. To understand the role of differential chromatin architecture in establishing tissue-specific expression patterns at IRD loci in the human neural retina and the RPE, we mapped genome-wide chromatin interactions by applying in situ Hi-C and H3K4me3 HiChIP to human adult post-mortem donor retinas. A comparative 3D genome analysis between neural retina and RPE revealed that almost 60% of known IRD genes were marked by differential cis-regulatory interactions or 3D genome structure. Furthermore, we zoomed in on tissue-specific chromatin interactions at the ABCA4 locus, which is implicated in the most common autosomal recessive IRD. We constructed high-resolution ABCA4 interaction profiles using UMI-4C, which, upon integration with bulk and single-cell epigenomic datasets and in vivo enhancer assays in zebrafish, revealed tissue-specific CREs for ABCA4. In summary, through extensive comparative 3D genome mapping, based on genome-wide (Hi-C), promoter-centric (HiChIP) and locus-specific (UMI-4C) assays of human neural retina and RPE, we have shown that gene regulation at key IRD loci is likely mediated by tissue-specific chromatin interactions. These findings do not only provide insight into tissue-specific regulatory landscapes at retinal disease loci, but also delineate the search space for genomic variation underlying unsolved IRD.","Vision depends on the functional interplay between the photoreceptor cells of the neural retina and the supporting cells of the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).

Dozens of monogenic IRDs could be potentially treated with a similar approach using adeno-associated virus (AAV) to transfer a functional gene into the retina. Here, we present the results of design, production and in vitro testing of the AAV serotype 9 (AAV9) vector carrying the codon-optimized (co) copy of aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein like-1 (AIPL1) as a possible treatment for LCA4. The pAAV-AIPL1co was able to successfully transduce retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) and initiate expression of human AIPL1. Intriguingly, cells transduced with AAV9-AIPL1co showed much less antiviral response than AAV9-AIPL1wt (wild type AIPL1 ) transduced. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of trans-differentiated ARPE-19 cells transduced with AAV9-AIPL1co demonstrated the significant differences in expression of genes involved in innate immune response. In contrast, AAV9-AIPL1wt induced prominent activation of multiple interferon-stimulated genes. The key part of possible regulatory molecular mechanism is activation of dsRNA-responsive antiviral oligoadenylate synthetases, and significant increase in level of histone coding genes’ transcripts overrepresented in RNA-seq data (i.e. H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). The RNA-seq data suggests that AAV9-AIPL1co exhibiting less immunogenicity than AAV9-AIPL1wt can be used for potency testing using relevant animal models to develop future therapeutics for LCA4.","In X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), the most common peroxisomal disorder, microglial defect is suggested to prime and amplify the neuroinflammatory process. By using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we recently established BV-2 microglial cell models to study the impact of dysfunctional peroxisomal b-oxidation and demonstrated the emergence of a disease-associated microglial signature in these cell lines. Their transcriptomic analysis suggested consequences on immune response. To go further, we have used RNA-sequencing and functional assays related to immune response to compare the WT and mutant BV-2 cell lines in basal conditions or upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Cytogenetics abnormalities (CA) are known to be the preponderant prognostic factor in multiple myeloma (MM). Our team has recently developeda prognostic score based on 6 CA, where del(1p32) appears to be the second worst abnormality after del(17p). The aim of this study was to confirm the adverse impact of 1p32 deletion on newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. Among 2551 NDMM patients, 11% were harboring del(1p32). Their overall survival (OS) was half as long as the OS of patients without del(1p32) (49 months vs. 124 months). Likewise, progression-free survival was significantly shorter. More importantly, double-deletion of the 1p32 locus conferred a dramatically poorer prognosis than a monoallelic del(1p32) (OS: 25 months vs. 60 months). As expected, the OS of del(1p32) patients significantly decreased when this abnormality was associated with other high-risk CA  (del(17p), t(4;14) or gain(1q)). In the multivariate analysis, del(1p32) appeared as a negative prognostic factor; after adjustment for age and treatment, the risk of progression was 1.3 times higher among patients harboring del(1p32), and the risk of death was 1.9 times higher. At the dawn of risk-adapted treatment strategies, we have confirmed the adverse impact of del(1p32) in MM and the relevance of its assessment at diagnosis.","Saturated very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA, ≥ C22), enriched in brain myelin and innate immune cells, accumulate in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). The severest form, inherited dysfunction of the VLCFA transporter ABCD1, underlying X-ALD, causes brain myelin destruction with infiltration of pro-inflammatory skewed monocytes/macrophages. How VLCFA levels relate to macrophage activation is unclear. Using whole transcriptome sequencing of X-ALD macrophages, we revealed that VLCFAs prime human macrophage membranes for inflammation and increase factors involved in chemotaxis and invasion. When applied externally, mimicking lipid destruction in X-ALD lesions, VLCFAs did not activate toll-like receptors in healthy cells but provoked pro-inflammatory responses through scavenger receptor CD36-mediated uptake, cumulating in JNK signalling and expression of matrix degrading enzymes and chemokine release. Following pro-inflammatory LPS-activation, VLCFA accumulated in healthy macrophages but were rapidly cleared with onset of resolution by increasing VLCFA degradation through liver-X-receptor mediated upregulation of ABCD1. ABCD1 deficiency impaired VLCFA homeostasis and prolonged pro-inflammatory gene expression. Our study uncovers a pivotal role for ABCD1, a protein linked to neuroinflammation, and associated peroxisomal VLCFA degradation in regulating macrophage plasticity.","Many transcription factors regulating the production, survival and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina have been identified, but little is known about transcriptional co-regulators in retinal health and disease. Here we show that BCL6 co-repressor (BCOR), a polycomb repressive complex I factor mutated in various cancers, negatively regulates photoreceptor gene expression. Using proteomics and promoter assays, we find that BCOR interacts with the photoreceptor transcription factors OTX2 and CRX, and reduces their ability to activate the promoters of photoreceptor-specific genes, such as Rhodopsin and Nrl. CUT&amp;RUN sequencing further shows that BCOR shares genome-wide binding profiles with CRX/OTX2, consistent with a general co-repression activity. Finally, we identify missense variants in the human BCOR gene in six families with early-onset X-linked inherited retinal degeneration (IRD). Together, this work uncovers BCOR as a co-repressor of OTX2/CRX essential for photoreceptor cell biology and survival.","Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a heterogeneous group of blinding disorders, which result in dysfunction or death of the light-sensing cone and rod photoreceptors. Despite individual IRDs being rare, collectively they affect up to 1:2000 people worldwide, causing a significant socioeconomic burden, especially when cone-mediated central vision is affected. This study uses the Pde6ccpfl1 mouse model of achromatopsia, a cone-specific vision loss IRD, to investigate the potential gene-independent therapeutic benefits of a histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 on cone cell survival. We investigated the effects of GSK-J4 treatment on cone cell survival in vivo and ex vivo and changes in cone-specific gene expression via single-cell RNA sequencing. A single intravitreal GSK-J4 injection led to transcriptional changes in pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, among other key epigenetic pathways, highlighting the complex interplay between methylation and acetylation in healthy and diseased cones. Furthermore, continuous administration of GSK-J4 in retinal explants increased cone survival. Our results suggest that IRD-affected cones respond positively to epigenetic modulation of histones, indicating the potential of this approach in the development of a broad class of novel therapies to slow cone degeneration.","Animal models have been utilized to understand the pathogenesis of Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSD), but the link between the clinical manifestations and molecular pathways has not yet been clearly established. We generated a peroxin 5 homozygous mutant zebrafish (pex5-/-) to gain insight into the molecular pathogenesis of peroxisome dysfunction. pex5-/- displays hallmarks of ZSD in humans and die within one month after birth. Fasting rapidly depletes the liver lipids and glycogen in pex5-/- and expedites their mortality. Mechanistically, abnormal mitochondrial activity and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling act together to induce metabolic alterations to deplete the hepatic nutrients and accumulate the damaged mitochondria. Accordingly, the use of chemical interventions blocking either the mitochondrial activities or the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 or a combination of both improves the metabolic imbalance shown in the fasted pex5-/- livers and extends the survival of the animals. Furthermore, the use of an autophagy activator also effectively ameliorated the early mortality of the fasted pex5-/-. These results suggest that fasting may be detrimental to patients with peroxisome dysfunction and that modulating the mitochondria, mTOR, or autophagy activities may provide a therapeutic option to alleviate the symptoms of peroxisomal diseases associated with metabolic dysfunction. ","Peroxisomes are highly abundant in proximal tubules where peroxisomal enzymes have been proposed to play an important role in a variety of metabolic and antioxidant functions. This hypothesis was supported by human genetic studies that identified mutations leading to peroxisomal biogenesis deficiency, resulting in severe multi-organ damage (Zellweger’s spectrum disorders (ZSD)), including renal impairment. However, the role of proximal tubule peroxisomes in renal (patho)physiology remains uninvestigated. We addressed this question in mice with conditional ablation of peroxisomal biogenesis in the renal tubule. Our results demonstrate that renal tubular peroxisomes are dispensable for normal renal function and suggest that renal damage in ZSD patients is of extrarenal origin.","Case series of children and adolescents undergoing growth hormone stimulation testing for investigation of short stature. The aim of this study was to identify whether a machine learning approach utilising gene expression data could predict which short children would test positive for GHD and which would not.","Continuous translation elongation, irrespective of amino acid sequences, is a prerequisite for living organisms to produce their proteomes. However, the risk of elongation abortion is concealed within nascent polypeptide products. For example, negatively charged sequences with occasional intermittent prolines, termed intrinsic ribosome destabilization (IRD) sequences, destabilizes the translating ribosomal complex. Thus, some nascent chain sequences lead to premature translation cessation. Here, we show that most potential IRD sequences in the middle of open reading frames remain cryptic by two mechanisms: the nascent polypeptide itself that spans the exit tunnel and its bulky amino acid residues that occupy the tunnel entrance region. Thus, nascent polypeptide products have a built-in ability to ensure elongation continuity by serving as a bridge and thus by protecting the large and small ribosomal subunits from dissociation.","Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are key cells that suppress periodontal damage during both the progression and recovery stages of periodontitis. Although substantial evidence has demonstrated that incubation under an inflammatory condition may accelerate senescence of PDLSCs, whether such cellular senescence contributes to inflammation-induced cell changes however remains unexplored. In this study, we first observed PDLSC senescence in periodontitis based on comparisons of matched patients, and this cellular senescence was demonstrated in healthy cells that were subjected to inflammatory conditions. We subsequently designed further experiments to investigate the possible mechanism underlying inflammation-induced PDLSC senescence with a particular focus on the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNA microarray analysis and functional gain/loss studies revealed AC025580.2 as a regulator of inflammation-mediated PDLSC senescence. By full-length transcriptome sequencing, we found that overexpressed AC025580.2 interacted with SRSF3 to promote the alternative splicing (AS) of TP53BP1, leading to the upregulation of the TP53BP1-204 transcript. Further functional studies showed that decreased expression of TP53BP1-204 reversed PDLSC senescence, and AC025580.2 overexpression-induced PDLSC senescence was abolished by TP53BP1-204 knockdown. Our data suggest for the first time that LncRNA AC025580.2 plays a key role in regulating PDLSC senescence in inflammatory environments by modulating the AS of TP53BP1.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other age-related disorders associated with demyelination exhibit sex differences. Here, we used single-nuclei transcriptomics to dissect the contributions of sex chromosomes and gonads in demyelination and AD. In a mouse model of demyelination, we identified the role of sex chromosomes and gonads in modifying microglia and oligodendrocyte responses before and after myelin loss. In an AD-related mouse model expressing APOE4, XY sex chromosomes heightened interferon response and tau-induced demyelination. The X-linked gene Toll-like receptor 7 (Tlr7) regulated sex-specific interferon response to myelin. Deletion of Tlr7 dampened sex differences while protecting against demyelination. Administering TLR7 inhibitor mitigated tau-induced motor impairment and demyelination in male mice, indicating that Tlr7 plays a role in the male-biased IFN-I response in aging- and AD-related demyelination. ","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other age-related disorders associated with demyelination exhibit sex differences.

Through this study, we aimed to identify regulatory noncoding RNAs and mRNAs involved in Epilepsy. A RNA-seq analysis was conducted to determine epilepsy-related noncoding RNAs and mRNAs. In summary, the newly identified circRNAs in networks and signaling pathways found in this study would provide hints for the development of novel prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies for Epilepsy.","eCLIP-seq data of METTL3 binding in shScr control and two shDAP3 knockdown samples","MeRIP-seq data of m6A signals in shScr control and two shDAP3 knockdown samples","Hexokinases (HXKs) are the key enzymes regulating glycolysis in cells. Overexpression of HXKs has been linked to numerous types of cancers and targeting HXKs has been suggested as a potential strategy of cancer therapy. How these abnormal HKs express affect epigenetics and gene expression is less understood. In this study, we artificially altered the HXKs expression level and test its impact on the parental nucleosome transfer process, a key replication coupled-epigenetic inheritance process, in yeast cells. Our result suggests the altered HXKs expression level has little effect on the parental nucleosome assembly and chromatin instability. However, 2- Deoxy-D-glucose(2DG), a HXK inhibitor, treatment cells show increased chromatin instability.","Mitochondria serve as the cellular powerhouse, and their distinct DNA makes them a prospective target for gene editing to treat genetic disorders. However, the impact of genome editing on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stability remains a mystery. Our study reveals previously unknown risks of genome editing that both nuclear and mitochondrial editing cause discernible transfer of mitochondrial DNA segments into the nuclear genome in various cell types including human cell lines, primary T cells, and mouse embryos. Furthermore, drug-induced mitochondrial stresses and mtDNA breaks exacerbate this transfer of mtDNA into the nuclear genome.

In mammals, damaged hair cells do not regenerate, resulting in permanent hearing loss. Reprogramming of the surrounding supporting cells to functional hair cells represent a novel strategy to hearing restoration. However, cellular processes governing the efficient and functional hair cell reprogramming are not completely understood. Employing the mouse cochlear organoid system, we performed detailed metabolomic characterizations of the expanding and differentiating organoids. We found that hair cell differentiation is associated with increased mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity and reactive oxidative species generation. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses indicate reduced expression of oxidoreductases and tricyclic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. The metabolic decoupling between ETC and TCA cycle limits the availability of the key metabolic cofactors, α-ketoglutarate and NAD+. Reduced expression of NAD+ in cochlear supporting cells by PGC1α deficiency further impairs hair cell reprogramming, while supplementation of α-ketoglutarate and NAD+ promotes hair cell reprogramming both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal metabolic rewiring as a central cellular process during hair cell differentiation, and highlight the insufficiency of key metabolites as a metabolic barrier for efficient hair cell reprogramming.","The strongest risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include the 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), the R47H variant of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), and female sex. Here, we combine APOE4 and TREM2R47H (R47H) in female P301S tauopathy mice to identify the pathways activated when AD risk is the strongest, thereby highlighting disease-causing mechanisms. We find that the R47H variant induces neurodegeneration in female APOE4 mice without impacting hippocampal tau load. The combination of APOE4 and R47H amplified tauopathy-induced cell-autonomous microglial cGAS-STING signaling and type-I interferon response, and interferon signaling converged across glial cell types in the hippocampus. APOE4-R47H microglia displayed cGAS- and BAX-dependent upregulation of senescence, showing association between neurotoxic signatures and implicating mitochondrial permeabilization in pathogenesis. By uncovering pathways enhanced by the strongest AD risk factors, our study points to cGAS-STING signaling and associated microglial senescence as potential drivers of AD risk.","STIM1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (Ca2+) sensor that serves to replenish ER Ca2+ stores in response to ER Ca2+ depletion through gating of plasmalemmal Orai1 channels in a process known as store operated calcium entry (SOCE). Previously, we have shown that SOCE is impaired in the diabetic pancreatic β cell; however, the consequences of reduced β cell SOCE have not been well studied. To test this, we generated mice with pancreatic β cell specific deletion of STIM1 (STIM1Δβ). Our results revealed a striking sexual dimorphism in metabolic phenotypes when STIM1Δβ mice were challenged with high fat diet for 8 weeks. Male STIM1Δβ mice showed no differences in total weight, lean or fat mass, or glucose tolerance compared to WT littermate controls. In contrast, female STIM1Δβ mice displayed significantly increased total body weight, fat mass, and reduced glucose tolerance, in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and β cell mass compared to WT littermate controls, while insulin sensitivity, food intake, and energy expenditure were unchanged.    To investigate mechanisms underlying these findings, RNA sequencing was performed in isolated islets and revealed altered 17-beta estradiol (E2) signaling, lipid metabolism, epithelial cell differentiation and decreased noncanonical estradiol receptor GPER. Consistent with this, alpha cell mass was increased in female STIM1Δβ, while proteomics and immunoblot analysis of STIM1 knockout (STIM1KO) INS-1 beta cells revealed reduce insulin expression and increased glucagon expression, suggesting STIM1 may be required for the maintenance of β cell identity. To this end, we show that a reduction of a noncanonical estradiol receptor GPER in STIM1 deficient islets contributes to the marked sexual dimorphism observed during beta cell dysfunction in female STIM1Δβ mice. This present study delineates a sexually dimorphic regulation of STIM1 in the maintenance of pancreatic beta cell identity through GPER and may expand the field of therapeutic approaches to diabetes. Our findings demonstrate the importance of STIM1 and GPER expression stability in the anti-diabetogenic response from estradiol.","Lipofuscin is an autofluorescent (AF) pigment formed by lipids and misfolded proteins that accumulates in post-mitotic cells with advanced age.  Here we immunophenotyped microglia in the brain of old C57BL/6 mice (&gt;18 months-old) and demonstrate that in comparison to young mice, one third of old microglia are AF, characterized by profound changes in lipid and iron content, phagocytic activity, and oxidative stress.  Pharmacological depletion of microglia in old mice eliminated the AF microglia following repopulation and reversed microglial dysfunction.  Age-related neurological deficits and neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury (TBI) were attenuated in old mice lacking AF microglia.  Furthermore, hyperphagocytic activity and lipid accumulation in microglia persisted for up to one year after TBI, was modified by Apoe4 genotype, and chronically driven by phagocyte-mediated oxidative stress.  Thus, AF may reflect a pathological state in aging microglia associated with hyperphagocytosis and inflammatory neurodegeneration that can be further accelerated by TBI.","To characterize and compare  XF-iMSC (XenoFree-induced Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells) and various types of MSCs (Adipose-, Bone marrow-, Unbilical cord-derived), we performed a transcriptome analysis of these MSCs","To clarify the changes in cell properties during the differentiation process from iPSCs into MSC through NCCs, we sampled each cell during the differentiation process and compared gene expression patterns.","To clarify the changes in cell properties during the differentiation process from iPSCs into NCCs, we sampled each cell during the differentiation process and compared gene expression patterns.","Dysregulation and abnormal expression of inflammatory mediators by keratinocytes promote the pathogenesis of the skin inflammation such as allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), that is expressed in the nucleus but released extracellularly upon inflammation has gained attention as an accelerator for skin inflammation. However, in vivo role of HMGB1 in ACD and other skin disorders remains to be elusive. In this study, we generated conditional knockout mice in which HMGB1 is deleted in keratinocytes and examined its role in skin inflammation models including 2,4-dinitrofluorobenezene (DNFB)-induced ACD. Unexpectedly, deletion of HMGB1 in keratinocytes exacerbated skin inflammation, accompanied by increased ear thickening. Elevated mRNA expression of interleukin-24 (IL-24), a known cytokine which promotes the pathogenesis of ACD, was also observed in the skin lesion of the mice. In accordance with above observations, both constitutive and IL-4-induced Il24 mRNA expression in vitro was augmented in hmgb1-deficient primary mouse keratinocytes and keratinocyte cell line PAM212 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed increased binding of tri-methyl histone H3 (lys4) (H3K4me3), a well-known histone mark for transcription active genes, to the promoter region of the Il24 gene in the hmgb1-deficient cells. ChIP-sequencing data also showed broad changes of H3K4me3 mark in the cells. Thus, HMGB1 in the nucleus dictates histone modifications. In conclusion, our study demonstrated a key role for HMGB1 in keratinocytes in the maintenance of chromatin modification status to protect from exuberant skin inflammation.","Immune responses in diverse tissue sites are critical for protective immunity and homeostasis. Here, we investigated how tissue localization regulates the development and function of human Natural Killer (NK) cells, an innate lymphocyte important for anti-viral and tumor immunity. Integrating high dimensional analysis of NK cells from blood, lymphoid organs and mucosal tissue sites from 48 individuals, we identify tissue-specific patterns of NK cell subset distribution, maturation and function across age and genetic diversity. Mature and terminally differentiated NK cells with enhanced effector function predominate in blood, bone marrow, spleen and lungs, exhibiting shared transcriptional programs across sites. By contrast, precursor and immature NK cells with reduced effector capacity prevail in lymph nodes and intestines, exhibiting tissue resident signatures and site-specific adaptations. Together, our results reveal anatomic control of NK cell development and maintenance as tissue resident populations, while mature, terminally differentiated subsets mediate immunosurveillance through diverse peripheral sites.","Human T cells coordinate adaptive immunity by localization in diverse tissue sites, though blood T cells are the most readily studied.  We investigated the functional responses of T cells isolated from human lungs (LG), lymph nodes (LN), bone marrow (BM), and blood to TCR-stimulation using single-cell RNA-seq. We defined cellular states for resting T cells including signatures that differentiate tissue and blood T cells and employed new factorization methods to identify activation states conserved across tissues, including an IFN-response activation state in CD4+T cells and distinct effector states specific to CD8+T cells. We demonstrate how this high-resolution map can be used to assess the origin and functional state of T cells in disease by projecting scRNAseq profiles of tumor-associated T cells from multiple cancers, revealing CD8 T cells that co-express markers of exhaustion, activation, and proliferation, and a lack of activated CD4 T cells. Our results establish a high-dimensional reference for human T cell homeostasis and function in multiple sites, from which to probe T cell dysfunction in disease.","Tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) maintain immunity in diverse sites as determined in mouse models, while their establishment and role in human tissues has been difficult to assess.  Here, we investigated human lung TRM generation, maintenance and function in airway samples obtained longitudinally from HLA-disparate lung transplant recipients, where donor and recipient T cells could be localized and tracked over time. Donor T cells persist specifically in the lungs (and not blood) of transplant recipients and express high levels of TRM signature markers including CD69, CD103, and CD49a, while lung-infiltrating recipient T cells gradually acquire TRM phenotypes over months in vivo. Single cell transcriptome profiling of airway T cells reveals that donor T cells comprise two TRM-like subsets with varying levels of expression of TRM-associated genes while recipient T cells comprised non-TRM and similar TRM-like subpopulations, suggesting de novo TRM generation. Transplant recipients exhibiting higher frequencies of persisting donor TRM experienced fewer adverse clinical events such as primary graft dysfunction and acute cellular rejection compared to recipients with low donor TRM persistence, suggesting that monitoring TRM dynamics could be clinically informative. Together, our results provide novel spatial and temporal insights into how human TRM develop, function, persist, and impact tissue integrity within the complexities of lung transplantation.","Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) accelerate pathogen clearance through rapid and enhanced functional responses in situ. In humans, TRM cells are prevalent in diverse anatomic sites throughout the human lifespan, yet mechanisms for long-term maintenance are unknown. Here, we identify subpopulations of human TRM in mucosal and lymphoid sites based on differential efflux of mitochondrial dyes, with distinct transcriptional profiles, turnover, and functional capacities. TRM are enriched in efflux(+) populations compared with circulating memory CD8+T cells. Compared to efflux- TRM, efflux(+) TRM showed transcriptional and phenotypic features of quiescence including reduced turnover, decreased expression of exhaustion markers, and increased proliferative capacity and signaling to homeostatic cytokines. Moreover, efflux(+) and efflux(-) TRM subsets both maintain TRM characteristics when activated, while efflux(+) TRM produce IL-17 and efflux(-) produce higher levels of IFN-γ and IL-2. Our results suggest a model for cooperative maintenance of T cell immunity in tissues through interplay of subsets with complementary capacities for longevity and effector function.","Tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) predominate in barrier sites and mediate protective immunity, while their role in lymphoid tissues is undefined. Here we analyzed memory CD8+ T cells in different lymphoid compartments including bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes (LN) relative to lung within diverse individuals. We identify an organ-specific subset in human LN (TLN) not found in blood or other tissues, expressing high levels of TCF-1 and transcriptionally enriched for markers of quiescence, self-renewal and follicular-helper cells. High dimensional CyTOF analysis reveals TLN as intermediate in differentiation between naive and TRM cells, with circulating memory T cells the most differentiated. TLN exhibit higher TCR diversity, lower in vivo turnover, yet higher proliferative responses compared to memory cells in other lymphoid or mucosal sites. These findings establish human LN as reservoirs for diverse memory T cells poised for high expansion and TLN as important targets for in vivo immunotherapies.","Tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) mediate optimal protection to site-specific pathogens in mouse models and are key targets for vaccines. In humans, the existence and defining properties of Positive remain unclear. Here, we performed in-depth transcriptome profiling and phenotypic and functional analyses of circulating and resident memory CD4+ and CD8+T cells from lungs, spleens, blood and intestines of 72 individuals, revealing a core gene set conserved between tissues, species, and T cell lineages. Human Positive exhibit increased expression of specific adhesion and regulatory molecules, increased capacity for pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokine production, and downregulation of molecules controlling responses to chemokines, tissue egress, and cell cycle control compared with circulating Negative cells. We further identify subsets of genes exhibiting tissue-specific expression patterns for mucosal and lymphoid sites. Our results indicate that human Positive constitute a subset distinct from circulatory Negative, with important implications for promoting anatomic localization of memory responses.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 play critical roles in stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses required for resistance to helminth infection and promotion of allergic inflammation, metabolic homeostasis and tissue repair.  Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are a potent source of type 2 cytokines and while significant advances have been made in understanding the cytokine milieu that promotes ILC2 responses, there are fundamental gaps in knowledge regarding how ILC2 responses are regulated by other stimuli. In this report, we demonstrate that ILC2s in the gastrointestinal tract co-localize with cholinergic neurons that express the neuropeptide neuromedin U (NMU). In contrast to other hematopoietic cells, ILC2s selectively express the NMU receptor 1 (NMUR1). In vitro stimulation of ILC2s with NMU induced rapid cell activation, proliferation and secretion of type 2 cytokines IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 that was dependent on cell-intrinsic expression of NMUR1 and Gaq protein. In vivo administration of NMU triggered potent type 2 cytokine responses characterized by ILC2 activation, proliferation and eosinophil recruitment that was associated with accelerated expulsion of the gastrointestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or induction of lung inflammation. Conversely, worm burden was higher in Nmur1-/- mice compared to control mice. Further, use of gene-deficient mice and adoptive cell transfer experiments revealed that ILC2s were necessary and sufficient to mount NMU-elicited type 2 cytokine responses. Together, these data indicate that the NMU-NMUR1 neuronal signaling circuit provides a selective and previously unrecognized mechanism through which the enteric nervous system and innate immune system integrate to promote rapid type 2 cytokine responses that can induce anti-microbial, inflammatory and tissue-protective type 2 responses at mucosal sites.","The type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 play critical roles in stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses required for resistance to helminth infection and promotion of allergic inflammation, metabolic homeostasis and tissue repair.

Although aberrant activation of several Wnt target genes, including CCND1 and MYC, has been reported as promoting proliferation of cancer cells, it is hardly enough to understand malignant phenotypes of cancer cells with aberrant Wnt signaling. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of beta-catenin/TCF target genes, we examined binding of beta-catenin (BC) to DNA by chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to genome tiling array (ChIP-on-chip).","Diet-induced obesity is reported to induce a phenotypic switch in adipose tissue macrophages from an antiinflammatory M2 state to a proinflammatory M1 state.   Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist and a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, reportedly has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity.  We studied the effects of telmisartan on the adipose tissue macrophage phenotype in high fat-fed mice.  Telmisartan was administered for 5 weeks to high fat-fed C57BL/6 mice.  Insulin sensitivity, macrophage infiltration, and the gene expressions of M1 and M2 markers in epididymal fat tissues were examined.  Insulin- or a glucose-tolerance test showed that telmisartan treatment improved insulin resistance, decreasing the body weight gain, visceral fat weight and adipocyte size without affecting the amount of food intake.  Telmisartan treatment reduced the number of CD11c-positive cells and crown-like structures.  Telmisartan reduced the mRNA expressions of M1 macrophage markers, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased the expression of M2 markers, such as IL-10 and Mgl2.  The reduction of M1 macrophage markers, as well as the increased gene expression of M2 markers especially IL-10, is a possible mechanism for the improvement of insulin sensitivity by telmisartan.","Series of samples studying effect of knock out Emx2 in urogenital epithelium of mouse embryos at E10.5.

","Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder. Subtypes of MPS III are caused by deficiencies in one of four enzymes required for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). An inability to degrade HS leads to progressive neurodegeneration and death in the second or third decades of life. Knowledge of MPS III pathogenesis is incomplete, and no effective therapies exist. We generated the hypomorphic mutations sgshS387Lfs, nagluA603Efs and hgsnatG577Sfsin the endogenous zebrafish genes orthologous to human SGSH, NAGLU, and HGSNAT that are loci for mutations causing MPS III subtypes MPS IIIA, B and C respectively. Our models display the primary MPS III disease signature of significant brain accumulation of HS, while behavioural analyses support hyperactivity phenotypes. Brain transcriptome analysis revealed changes related to lysosomal, glycosaminoglycan, immune system and iron homeostasis biology in all three models but also distinct differences in brain transcriptome state between models. The transcriptome analysis also indicated marked disturbance of the oligodendrocyte cell state in the brains of MPS IIIA, B and C zebrafish, supporting that effects on this cell type are an early and consistent characteristic of MPS III. Overall, our zebrafish models recapture key characteristics of the human disease and phenotypes seen in mouse models. Our models will allow exploitation of the zebrafish’s extreme fecundity and accessible anatomy to dissect the pathological mechanisms both common and divergent between the MPS IIIA, B, and C subtypes.","Lipofuscin is an autofluorescent (AF) pigment formed by lipids and misfolded proteins that accumulates in post-mitotic cells with advanced age.

","Extensive transcriptomic changes associated with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in mice: Differential effects in dorsal root ganglia and the sciatic nerve Background: Paclitaxel (Ptx)-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN), a common side effect of this anti-cancer drug, causes chronic pain reflecting the molecular changes in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of the sciatic nerve (SN). While the subcellular localization and spatio-temporal control of mRNA translation are critical to nerve function, little is known about the transcriptional landscapes of DRG and SN in PIPN.  Aim: Transcriptome-wide assessment of Ptx-induced changes in gene expression and mRNA distribution in DRG or SN. Methods: Gene expression microarray analysis of the subcellular transcriptomes of DRG and SN in normal and PIPN mice with Transcriptome Analysis Console followed by analysis with 11 pathway databases. Validation of selected results in cultured cells and animal tissues.  Results: In normal mice, transcripts were differentially distributed in DRG and SN. In PIPN, both the gene expression profile and the distribution of the transcripts between DRG and SN were changed compared to normal controls. Functional analysis of gene clusters confirmed changes in pathways known to be affected by Ptx including including cytoskeleton remodeling, cell cycle regulation, immune response and neuronal transmission, as well as less studied pathways such as fatty acid metabolism, Rho GTPases in Wnt signaling, G-protein signal transduction, mRNA splicing and editing. Although the expression and function of cytoskeleton genes is known to be disturbed by Ptx, we found actins, actinins and non-muscle myosins (actomyosin contractility cluster) to be overexpressed by Ptx and accumulated specifically in the SN. For instance, in PIPN, the normalized ratio of SN/DRG mRNA levels for Myh7, Myh2, Actn2, Acta2 and Actb was 32.4, 24.5, 21.9, 3.6 and 3.3 respectively. We also identified transcripts overexpressed and accumulated in PIPN DRGs, with the highest DRG/SN mRNA ratios found for ion channels (ratios in parentheses) SN10a, Kcnd1, Atp1a3, Kcnip3, SN11a, (10.3-21.2); neurotransmitter regulators Syt1, Gabbr2 (14.4, 13.2); fatty acid regulators: Fabp4, Adipoq (22.9, 4.8), some tubulins: Tubb3, Tubb4a, Tubb4b (9.15, 5.5, 2.0) as well as GPCR regulating proteins: Rasgrp1, Gnal, Olfr1098 (16.7, 7.6, 2.0). Furthermore, the  Wikipathways integrated with the Transcriptome Analysis Console revealed that GPCRs were the most significantly altered class of genes, predominantly downregulated by Ptx compared to Naive samples in the DRG (320 downregulated, 88 upregulated) and in the SN (469 downregulated, 74 upregulated). In contrast, the comparison of control Naive samples in the DRG versus SN showed minimal changes (21 downregulated, 5 upregulated). These changes were statistically significant with a p-value &lt; 0.001 and a fold change of -2 &gt; FC &gt; 2.  Conclusion: Our results show that Ptx not only affects the gene expression but also the subcellular localization of transcripts kept in DRG bodies or over-transported to distal parts of Sciatic Nerve along the longest axon of the body. Cargo trafficking including RNA shuttles among nucleus- cytoplasm-axon terminal of nerves might be one of the most critical processes impaired in PIPN. These results might be used in the future to develop a potential therapeutic strategy focusing on normalization of axon cargo trafficking and PIPN prevention.","Up to 80% of patients surviving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection present persistent anomalies in pulmonary function after hospital discharge. There is a limited understanding of the mechanistic pathways linked to post-acute pulmonary sequelae. Our main goal was to identify the molecular underpinnings associated with severe lung diffusion involvement in survivors of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. Survivors attended to a complete pulmonary evaluation 3 months after hospital discharge. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed using Illumina technology in whole-blood samples from 50 patients with moderate to severe diffusion impairment (DLCO&lt;60%) and age- and sex-matched individuals with mild-normal lung function (DLCO≥60%). A transcriptomic signature for optimal classification was constructed using random forest. Transcriptomic data were analyzed for biological pathway enrichment, cellular deconvolution, cell/tissue-specific gene expression and candidate drugs. RNA-seq identified 1357 differentially expressed transcripts. A model composed of 14 mRNAs allowed the optimal discrimination of survivors with severe diffusion impairment (AUC=0.979). Hallmarks of lung sequelae involved cell death signaling, cytoskeleton reorganization, cell growth and differentiation and the immune response. Resting natural killer (NK) cells were the most important immune cell subtype for the prediction of severe diffusion impairment. Components of the signature correlated with neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts. A variable expression profile of the transcripts was observed in lung cell subtypes and bodily tissues. One upregulated gene, TUBB4A, constitutes a target for FDA-approved drugs. This work defines the transcriptional programme associated with post-acute pulmonary sequelae and provides novel insights for targeted interventions and biomarker development.","FOXF1, a member of the forkhead box family of transcription factors, has been previously shown to be critical for lung development, homeostasis, and injury responses. However, the role of FOXF1 in lung regeneration is unknown. Herein, we performed partial pneumonectomy, a model of lung regeneration, in mice lacking one Foxf1 allele in endothelial cells (PDGFb-iCre/Foxf1fl/+ mice). Endothelial cell proliferation was significantly reduced in regenerating lungs from mice deficient for endothelial Foxf1. Decreased endothelial proliferation was associated with delayed lung regeneration as shown by reduced respiratory volume in Foxf1-deficient lungs. FACS-sorted endothelial cells isolated from regenerating PDGFb-iCre/Foxf1fl/+ and control lungs were used for RNAseq analysis to identify FOXF1 target genes. Foxf1 deficiency altered expression of numerous genes including those regulating extracellular matrix remodeling (Timp3, Adamts9) and cell cycle progression (Cdkn1a, Cdkn2b, Cenpj, Tubb4a), which are critical for lung regeneration. Deletion of Foxf1 increased Timp3 mRNA and protein, decreasing MMP14 activity in regenerating lungs. ChIPseq analysis for FOXF1 and histone methylation marks identified DNA regulatory regions with the Cd44, Cdkn1a, and Cdkn2b genes, indicating they are direct FOXF1 targets. Thus FOXF1 stimulates lung regeneration following partial pneumonectomy via direct transcriptional regulation of genes critical for extracellular matrix remodeling and cell cycle progression.","Red fruits are valued for their vitamin C and polyphenol content, but traditional heat preservation methods used in juice and nectar production can significantly reduce these components. Therefore, alternative non-thermal methods are explored to inactivate foodborne pathogens like Escherichia coli while maintaining the nutritional value. However, knowledge about the effects of these technologies on bacterial cells is limited. This study analyzed differentially expressed genes of E. coli ATCC 8739 inoculated in strawberry nectar after exposure to three treatments with two sets of parameters each, namely thermal treatment, high-pressure processing (HPP), and moderate-intensity pulsed electric field (MIPEF). The highest inactivation efficiency was achieved with HPP at 400 MPa, 1 min, reducing microbial counts by 5.0±0.3 log cfu/mL, and thermal treatment at 60°C, 200 s, achieving a reduction of 4.4±0.2 log cfu/mL, while no inactivation was observed with MIPEF at 6 kV/cm. Transcriptomic analysis showed that thermal and HPP treatments caused similar molecular stress responses in E. coli. In both cases, the most overexpressed genes encoded outer membrane proteins, which may lead to the activation of the envelope stress response. Despite no microbial inactivation was revealed after MIPEF treatment, strong transcriptomic responses were observed, particularly in genes related to membrane integrity and metabolic activity. Numerous overexpressed genes associated with ABC transporters, outer membrane proteins, and lipoproteins were identified, which could increase the strain’s virulence. This study provides insights into the stress response mechanisms induced by conventional and novel treatments. Nevertheless, further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects on bacterial populations.","Treponema denticola has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. Previously, we reported increased expression of TDE_0259 (oxtR), which exhibits similarities with the multiple-antibiotic resistance regulator (marR)-like gene in the bacteriocin ABC transporter gene-deficient mutant, which altered susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Therefore, we investigated the function of oxtR in T. denticola using an oxtR-deficient mutant. We observed increased OxtR expression upon oxygen exposure. The growth rate of the bacterium was unaffected by the inactivation of oxtR. We observed a relative increase in the expression of genes associated with iron-sulfur cluster-binding proteins, flavodoxin, oligopeptide/dipeptide ABC transporters, heat shock proteins, DNA helicase, iron compounds, ABC transporters, and lipoproteins. The oxtR mutant exhibited an increased minimum inhibitory concentration against ofloxacin. In addition, the mutant showed a slightly faster growth rate than that of the wild type under oxygen stress. Our findings also suggested that OxtR may regulate the operon by binding to a potential promoter region. The oxygen-sensing regulator oxtR plays a role in regulating the expression of a potential ferredoxin, which may contribute to the response to oxygen-induced stress in T. denticola.","Both Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are associated with an increased risk of malignancies. People living with HIV frequently have EBV reactivation and develop EBV-associated B-cell malignancies. In this study, we aimed to uncover the involvement of HIV-1 and EBV co-existence in the development of B-cell malignancies. We studied two viral transcriptional activators (HIV-1 Tat and EBV Zta) and their possible interaction since they both have cell-penetration domains and can be found simultaneously in the blood or cells of people with HIV. We found that Tat and Zta directly bound each other in human B cells, T cells, and blood serum. Using RNA-sequencing, we found that combined Tat and Zta action in B cells differed from a simple combination of two proteins. A subset of genes, activated by Tat or Zta alone, that trigger an immune response and antigen presentation in B cells, remained unchanged when two proteins were combined. B cells, treated or transfected with Tat and Zta, exhibited a substantial decrease in HLA-ABC (MHC class I) expression, a critical component of the antigen processing and presentation pathway. HLA-ABC downregulation induced by Tat and Zta interaction conferred protection against cytotoxic T cell recognition of EBV-infected B cells. Tat and Zta interaction was also observed in serum from an HIV-positive individual. To conclude, we demonstrated for the first time the direct interaction between HIV-1 Tat and EBV Zta; this interaction can bring about immune evasion of EBV-infected or transformed B cells.","Comparing  the effects of artesunate versus DMSO in three DLBCL cell lines, we found a decrease in cell viability to 80%-60%. Over increasing artesunate dosage,we found increasing ROS generation and lipid peroxidation. In combination with the Ferrostatin-1 rescue experiment, we conclude that cell death induced by artesunate is ferroptotic. We compared the transcriptome of the U2932 cell line with and without 100µm artesunate in triplicate. A ferroptosis gene signature is shown to be enriched among the upregulated genes of this comparison. GPX4 protein expression was shown to be downregulated after artesunate in U2932 cells, but not in the rescue experiment with Ferrostatin-1. MT1G gene expression was identified as required for artesunate-mediated ferroptosis via targeted suppression by shRNAs. We present significantly decreased cell viability when combining artesunate with doxorubicin, suggesting a potential translation into clinic for treatment of ABC and GCB DLBCL.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Adoptive transfer of donor regulatory T cells (Treg) is a promising treatment option for Graft-versus-Host disease (GvHD), but has not yet found its way into routine clinical practice. To map distinctive properties of protective Treg (generated by either polyclonal or allogeneic in vitro expansion), we followed their fate in recipient organs (spleen, liver, colon) in a prophylactic mouse model of MHC-mismatched bone-marrow transplantation (BMT). Using comprehensive gene expression and T cell receptor profiling, we show that both in vitro expansion protocols generated Treg products that preserved hallmark Treg properties,  ameliorated GvHD symptoms, retained their phenotypic plasticity and rapidly acquired organ-specific gene expression profiles after BMT, comparable to their tissue-resident counterparts. When co-transplanted with GvHD-inducing T cells, Treg enabled hallmark suppressive and cytotoxic features, most evidently in the colon. Dominant Treg T cell receptor clonotypes were evenly distributed between organs and across recipients, suggesting a major role of ubiquitous alloantigen-specific Treg in controlling GvHD. Effective protection inversely correlated with the relative abundance of organ-specific Treg, that were transcriptionally distinct, less “activated” and preferentially accumulated in the colon of recipients receiving polyclonally expanded Treg. In summary, we provide a detailed atlas of Treg selection and adaptation in the prophylactic therapy of GvHD.","Fungal infections have become a clinical challenge due to the emergence of drug-resistance of invasive fungi and a rapid increase of novel pathogens. The development of drug resistance has further restricted the use of antifungal agents. Therefore, there is anurgentneedto searchforalternativetreatmentoptions for Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans). Disulfiram (DSF) has a high human safety profile and promising applications as an antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, and anticancer agent. In contrast, the effect of DSF on Cryptococcus has yet to be thoroughly researched. This study investigated the antifungal effect and mechanism of DSF againstC. neoformansto provide a new theoretical foundation for treating Cryptococcal infections. In vitro studies demonstrated that DSF inhibitedCryptococcusat minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 μg/mL. Combined antifungal effects were also observed with 5-fluorocytosine, amphotericin B, terbinafine, or ketoconazole. In vivo, DSF exerted asignificantprotectiveeffectforGalleria mellonella infected with C. neoformans.Mechanistic investigations showed that DSF dose-dependently inhibited the melanin, urease, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, capsule, and biofilm formation or viability ofC. neoformans.Further study indicated DSF affectedC. neoformansby interfering with multiple biological pathways, including replication, metabolism, membrane transport, and biological enzyme activity. Potentially essential targets of these pathways included acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, catalase, ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter) AFR2, and iron-sulfur cluster transporter ATM1. These findings contribute to the understanding of mechanisms inC. neoformans, and provide new insights for the application of DSF.","Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) is one of the most destructive pathogens of cherry tomatoes, causing fruit decay and economic loss. Fludioxonil is an effective fungicide widely used for crop protec-tion and is essential for controlling tomato gray mold. The emergence of fungicide-resistant strains has made the control of Botrytis cinerea more difficult. While the genome of Botrytis cinerea is available, there are few reports regarding the large-scale functional annotation of the genome using expressed genes derived from transcriptomes, and the mechanism(s) underlying such flu-dioxonil resistance remain unclear. The present study prepared RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) li-braries for three Botrytis cinerea strains [two highly resistant (LR and FR) versus one highly sen-sitive (S) to fludioxonil], with and without fludioxonil treatment, to identify fludioxonil responsive genes that facilitate fungicide resistance. Functional enrichment analysis identified nine resistant related DEGs in the fludioxonil-induced LR and FR transcriptome that were simultaneously up regulated, and seven resistant related DEGs down regulated. These included adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-encoding genes, major facilitator super-family (MFS) transporter-encoding genes, and the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway homologues or related genes. The expression patterns of twelve out of the sixteen fludioxo-nil-responsive genes, obtained from the RNA-sequence data sets were validated using quantita-tive real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Based on RNA-sequence analysis it was found that fugal HHKs, like BOS1, BcHHK2, and Bchhk17, were in some way involved in the fludioxonil resistance of B. cinerea, in addition, a number of ABC and MFS transporter genes that were not reported before, such as BcATRO, BMR1, BMR3, BcNMT1, BcAMF1, BcTOP1, BcVBA2, and BcYHK8 were differen-tially expressed in the fludioxonil-resistant strains, indicating that overexpression of these efflux transporters located in the plasma membranes played a crucial role in the fludioxonil resistant mechanism of B. cinerea. These lines of evidence together allowed us to draw a general portrait of the anti-fludioxonil mechanisms for Botrytis cinerea, and the assembled and annotated transcrip-tome data provide valuable genomic resources for further study of the molecular mechanisms of B. cinerea resistance to fludioxonil.","The generation and purification of cardiomyocyte sub-population are critical for precise modelling of cardiac diseases, drug screening, and regenerative medicine due to their distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics. Therefore, identifying surface markers for cardiomyocyte subtypes that facilitate live cell sorting of homogenous population of cardiomyocytes is of utmost importance for successful translation of cardiovascular research and therapeutic applications. Using MARIS method coupled with RNA sequencing analysis on MLC2A- and MLC2V-expressing cardiomyocytes, we identified JAK2 as a potential cell surface marker for purifying ventricular cardiomyocytes. We demonstrated that that SIRPA+/JAK2+ population sorted expressed high levels of ventricular-specific marker and had electrophysiological properties that corresponded to ventricular-like cardiomyocytes. Functionally, SIRPA+/JAK2+ cardiomyocytes do not response to vernakalant, an atrial-selective anti-arrhythmic agent, confirming their identity as ventricular-like cells.","Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive B cell lymphoma and accounts for nearly 40% of cases of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. DLBCL is generally treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy, but many patients do not respond or relapse after treatment. Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of the tumor suppressor microRNA-28 (miR-28) for DLBCL, alone and in combination with the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Combination therapy with miR-28 plus ibrutinib potentiated the anti-tumor effects of monotherapy with either agent by inducing a specific transcriptional cell-cycle arrest program that impairs DNA replication. The molecular actions of miR-28 and ibrutinib synergistically impair DNA replication by simultaneous inhibition of origin activation and fork progression. Moreover, we found that downregulation of the miR-28-plus-ibrutinib gene signature correlates with better survival of ABC-DLBCL patients. These results provide evidence for the effectiveness of a new miRNA-based ibrutinib combination therapy for DLBCL and unveil the miR-28-plus-ibrutinib gene signature as a new predictor of outcome in ABC-DLBCL patients.","Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive B cell lymphoma and accounts for nearly 40% of cases of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

However, the dynamic interaction between H. pylori and human gastric epithelium has not been fully documented. Here, by leveraging the advantage of dual RNA sequencing technology, we characterized a cytotoxin-associated genes A (CagA)-modulated bacterial adoption strategy by reinforcing the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-related genes, metQ and HP_0888 upon co-culturing with human gastric epithelial cells (GES-1), thus, to benefit intracellular H. pylori survival through facilitating the uptake of host-provided nutrients. We further detected a generally repressed impact on electron transportation-associated genes by CagA, leading to the activation of oxidative phosphorylation. Temporal profiling of host mRNA signatures revealed down-regulation of multiple splicing regulators elicited by bacterial infection. Consequently, aberrant pre-mRNA splicing of functional genes that were involved in cell cycle process in response to H. pylori infection were identified. Moreover, we verified a protective effect for gastric H. pylori colonization against chronic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Mechanistically, we profiled a cluster of short chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria, Muribaculaceae that was selectively enriched in H. pylori-pre-colonized mice colon, contributing to the restoration of intestinal barrier function damaged by DSS treatment. Taken together, this study represents the first dual-transcriptome analysis of H. pylori during dynamic interaction with gastric epithelium and provide new insights into H. pylori pathogenesis.","Tirabrutinib is a highly selective BTK inhibitor for treating hematological malignancies. This study analyzed the anti-tumor mechanism of tirabrutinib with microarray analysis of ABC-DLBCL xenograft model tumors. The comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed that tirabrutinib downregulated IRF-4, MYC, and mTORC1 pathway-related genes in TMD8, suggesting the crucial roles of these pathways in ABC-DLBCL.","Characterization of biological and chemical responses to ionizing radiation by various organisms is essential for potential applications in bioremediation, alternative modes of detecting nuclear material, and national security. Escherichia coli DH10β is an optimal system to study the microbial response to low-dose ionizing radiation at the transcriptional level because it is a well-characterized model bacterium and its responses to other environmental stressors, including those to higher radiation doses, have been elucidated in prior studies. In this study, RNA sequencing with downstream transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) was employed to characterize the global transcriptional response of stationary-phase E. coli subjected to Pu-239, H-3 (tritium), and Fe-55, at an approximate absorbed dose rate of 10 mGy day-1 for 1 day and 15 days. Differential expression analysis identified significant changes in gene expression of E. coli for both short- and long-term exposures. Radionuclide source exposure induced differential expression in E. coli of genes involved in biosynthesis pathways of nuclear envelope components, amino acids, and siderophores, transport systems such as ABC transporters and type II secretion proteins, and initiation of stress response and regulatory systems of temperature stress, the RpoS regulon, and oxidative stress. These findings provide a basic understanding of the relationship between low-dose exposure and biological effect of a model bacterium that is critical for applications in alternative nuclear material detection and bioremediation. IMPORTANCE Escherichia coli strain DH10β, a well-characterized model bacterium, was subjected to short-term (1-day) and long-term (15-day) exposures to three different in situ radiation sources comprised of radionuclides relevant to nuclear activities to induce a measurable and identifiable genetic response. We found E. coli had both common and unique responses to the three exposures studied, suggesting both dose rate- and radionuclide-specific effects. This study is the first to provide insights into the transcriptional response of a microorganism in short- and long-term exposure to continuous low-dose ionizing radiation with multiple in situ radionuclide sources and the first to examine microbial transcriptional response in stationary phase. Moreover, this work provides a basis for the development of biosensors and informing more robust dose-response relationships to support ecological risk assessment.","Bacillus anthracis causes anthrax infections in mammals. Large-scale mortality resulting from the intentional release of B. anthracis spores represents a potential bioterrorism threat. Inhalational anthrax almost invariably proceeds to fatal systemic infection, characterized by massive bacteremia. A better understanding of host-pathogen interactions is urgently needed for effective treatment of this lethal disease. However, virulence mechanisms used by B. anthracis to survive and multiply in human blood are not completely understood. Identification of genes that are differentially expressed during the growth of B. anthracis in human serum can elucidate how this pathogen successfully colonizes the bloodstream. We compared the transcriptional profile of B. anthracis growing in heat-inactivated human serum to that in LB medium. Genes involved in the biosynthesis of purines, certain amino acids and riboflavin and lipid metabolism, genes encoding ABC transporters, respiratory enzymes and several genes with hypothetical function were identified as being upregulated during growth in serum.","Different mammalian species vary greatly in their daily sleep quota, ranging from 2-4 hours in giraffes to 20-22 hours in koalas and bats. In humans, the sleep quantity and quality of individuals are governed by genetic factors and exhibit age-dependent variations. However, the molecular pathways and effector mechanisms that regulate daily sleep need in mammals remain unknown. Here, using an adult brain chimeric (ABC)-expression/knockout (KO) system for somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult mice, we report that gain-of-function of histone deacetylases HDAC4/5 significantly reduces, whereas loss-of-function of HDAC4/5 increases daily non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) amount and delta power–two key indicators of sleep need. Similarly, ABC-expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) or A-CREB, an inhibitor of transcriptional activity of CREB, decreases or increases NREMS amount and delta power, respectively. A combination of genetic and transcriptomic analysis reveals that HDAC4 functions in tandem with CREB in both transcriptional and sleep regulation. Consistent with their functions downstream of LKB1-SIK3 kinase cascade, ABC-expression of HDAC4/5CA or CREB rescues hypersomnia of Sik3E13∆/+ mice, whereas ABC-expression of SIK3/SLP-ST221E or HDAC(4+5)VP16 rescues insomnia of ABC-Lkb1KO mice. Taken together, these results identify LKB1-SIK3-HDAC4/5-CREB as the first major molecular pathway for transcriptional regulation of daily sleep need in mammals.","In mice and humans, sleep quantity of individuals are governed by genetic factors and exhibit age-dependent variations. However, the core molecular pathways and effector mechanisms that regulate sleep time in mammals remain unclear. Here, we characterize a major signaling pathway for transcriptional regulation of sleep quantity in mice by adeno-associated virus-mediated somatic genetics analysis. Adult brain chimeric-knockout of LKB1 kinase, an activator of AMPK-related protein kinase SIK3/SLEEPY, markedly reduces non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) amount and delta power–a measure of sleep depth. Downstream of LKB1-SIK3 pathway, gain or loss-of-function of histone deacetylases HDAC4/5 in adult brain neurons causes bidirectional changes of NREMS amount and delta power. Phosphorylation of HDAC4/5 is regulated in relation to sleep need, and HDAC4 specifically regulates sleep amount in posterior hypothalamus. Genetic and transcriptomic studies reveal that HDAC4 cooperates with CREB in both transcriptional and sleep regulation. These findings introduce the concept of signaling pathways targeting transcription modulators to regulate daily sleep amount and demonstrate utility of somatic genetics in mouse sleep research.","The degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by intestinal bacteria is critical for their colonization in the human gut and the health of the host. Both Bacteroides and Firmicutes have been reported to degrade GAGs, while the enzymatic details of the latter remain largely unknown. In this study, we isolated a Firmicutes strain, Hungatella hathewayi N2-326, that can catabolize various GAGs. While H. hathewayi N2-326 was less efficient in utilizing chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) and dermatan sulfate (DS) than Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a characterized GAG degrader, it outperformed B. thetaiotaomicron in assimilating hyaluronic acid. Unlike B. thetaiotaomicron, H. hathewayi N2-326 could not utilize heparin. The chondroitin lyase activity of H. hathewayi N2-326 was found to be induced by CSA and displayed both cell-associated and extracellular distributions. We further identified and characterized the first chondroitin ABC lyase from Firmicutes. The recombinant H. hathewayi chondroitin ABC lyase was found to be a predominantly exolyase and exhibited higher specific activity than any other characterized chondroitin ABC lyase. Thus, the HH-chondroitin ABC lyase offers a viable commercial option for the production of chondroitin, dermatan, and hyaluronan oligosaccharides and potential medical applications.","Background: Nucleosome organization within chromatin can be altered through the incorporation of histone modifications that in turn affects gene expression. Accordingly, the Polycomb Group (PcG) complexes PRC1 and PRC2 through the incorporation of H2AK121ub and H3K27me3 marks, respectively, maintain the repression of target genes; however, little is known about the exact function of these modifications in shaping nucleosome array at target genes, especially in plants.    Results: By using two different MNase-seq datasets we analyzed the nucleosome occupancy profile of different PcG target genes in Arabidopsis. We found that PcG targets strongly differ in their nucleosome organization depending on the marks that they carry. Our data indicate that H2AK121ub marks play a role in fine-tuning +1 nucleosome position, while H3K27me3 marks impact nucleosome spacing and chromatin accessibility at both promoter and gene regions. Furthermore, analyzing the nucleosome profile of transcriptionally active PcG target genes in WT seedlings we found that their apparent activated state may be actually due to transcriptional heterogeneity across different cells.   Conclusion: Our findings show that H2AK121ub and H3K27me3 marks differentially affect nucleosome organization in Arabidopsis, displaying additive effects when co-localizing at target genes.","Aortic single-cell RNA sequencing data from Fbn1C1041G/+ mice treated with GLPG0187 or vehicle control.","Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is a systemic autoimmune-like syndrome.  The role of Tph cells in the pathogenesis of cGVHD has not been examined, although previous studies have shown that cGVHD is characterized by loss of Tfh cells. Here, we show that in cGVHD patients and in a murine model that reflects characteristic features of human cGVHD, the proportions of Tph cells among CD4+ T cells in the blood were expanded.  These cells augmented memory B cell differentiation and production of IgG via IL-21. Adoptive transfer experiments showed recirculation between Tph in the blood and tissue-resident T helper (Trh) cells in GVHD target tissues.  The TCR repertoires of blood Tph cells and Trh cells in GVHD target tissues of mice were highly overlapping.","Monocytic leukemia Zinc finger protein (MOZ) is a MYST-type acetyltransferase involved in chromosomal translocation in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome. MOZ is established as essential for hematopoiesis; however, the role of MOZ in AML has not been addressed. We propose that MOZ is critical for AML development induced by MOZ-TIF2 fusions. Moz-deficient hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) expressing MOZ-TIF2 could form colonies in vitro but could not induce AML in mice. By contrast, Moz was dispensable for colony formation by HOXA9-transduced cells and AML development caused by HOXA9 and MEIS1, suggesting a specific requirement for MOZ in AML induced by MOZ/MLL-fusions. Expression of the of Meis1, but not Hoxa9, was reduced in Moz-deficient MOZ-TIF2 AML cells. AML development induced by MOZ-TIF2 was rescued by introducing Meis1 into Moz-deficient cells carrying MOZ-TIF2. Meis1 deletion impaired MOZ-TIF2­-mediated AML development. Active histone modifications were also severely reduced at the Meis1 locus in Moz-deficient MOZ-TIF2 AML cells. These results suggest that endogenous MOZ is critical for MOZ-fusion-induced AML development and maintains active chromatin signatures at target gene loci.","Aortic single-cell RNA sequencing data from second heart field lineage traced mice with Fbn1C1041G/+ and control mice.","Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 and it predisposes to hematological disorders such as transient myeloproliferative disorder and acute megakaryocytic leukemia. Our previous study identified a gain-of-function mutation of TRIB1 encoding a pseudokinase that suppresses C/EBP and enhances MEK/ERK signaling. In this study, we aimed to examine whether Trib1 expression cooperates with trisomy 21 in the development of leukemia. The wild type or R107L mutant Trib1 was retrovirally introduced into bone marrow cells derived from the Ts1Cje Down syndrome model mice or C57Bl6/J mice. Trib1 expression in hematopoietic cells of Ts1Cje mice accelerated the onset of AML development compared with that in wild type mice. Gene expression analysis showed up-regulation of Hox downstream genes and down-regulation of genes for the myeloid differentiation program and C/EBP targets. These results suggest that Trib1-mediated signaling plays an important role in promoting leukemogenesis in Down syndrome. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in mouse AML","We report dynamic temporal and spatial smooth muscle cell phenotype modulation using aortic single cell RNA sequencing in a murine model of Marfan syndrome (Fbn1C1041G/+) and littermate controls. Aortic root/ascending aortic tissue samples from both genotypes were studied at 4 and 24 weeks of age. The non-aneurysmal descending thoracic aorta was also studied at 24 weeks. Finally human aortic tissue from a Marfan syndrome patient undergoing aneurysm repair surgery was studied.","Gorlin syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome that predisposes a patient to the formation of basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts, and skeletal anomalies. Patched-1 (PTCH1) is a Hedgehog (Hh) receptor that acts as a negative regulator of constitutive Hh signaling by preventing the G protein-coupled receptor Smoothened from entering the cilium in the absence of Hh protein binding. We generated iPSCs from four unrelated Gorlin syndrome patients with loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1 using the Sendai virus vector (SeVdp(KOSM)302).  The patient-derived iPSCs exhibited basic iPSC features, including stem cell marker expression, totipotency, and the ability to form teratomas. To check the Patient-derived iPSCs mimic patinet phenotype, We performted osteoblast differentiation and checked mRNA expression by hedgehog PCR array systems.","Global transcriptional analysis of chronic DZP administrated mouse brain using microarrays identified some up- and down- regulated genes after chronic DZP administrations. Diazepam (DZP), a medication of the benzodiazepine family, is widely used to treat various conditions including anxiety, muscle spasms, seizures, trouble sleeping, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Chronic DZP treatment has significant risks such as tolerance, dependence, withdrawal effect and Alzheimer's disease. As the molecular mechanisms of these risks were complex processes, global analysis has been required.","&lt;Objective&gt; To compare gene expression in labial salivary glands (LSG) of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). &lt;Methods&gt; Gene expression was analyzed by DNA microarray in LSG of IgG4-RD (n=5), SS (n=5), and healthy controls (n=3). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IgG4-RD and SS were identified, and gene-annotation enrichment analysis of these DEGs was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. Validation of the result was performed by quantitative PCR using LSG from IgG4-RD (n=9), SS (n=10), and controls (n=4). &lt;Results&gt; Gene expression patterns in IgG4-RD, SS, and healthy controls were quite different with each other in hierarchical clustering as well as principal component analysis. In IgG4-RD, 1771 up-regulated probe sets (corresponding to 1321 up-regulated genes) and 1785 down-regulated probe sets (corresponding to 1320 down-regulated genes) were identified as DEGs (false discovery rate &lt;0.05). GO term analysis indicated that the up-regulated set of DEGs in IgG4-RD encoded proteins that function in cell proliferation, extracellular matrix organization, and organ development. PCR validated significantly higher expression of lactotransferrin (LTF) in IgG4-RD than SS (P&lt;0.05), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18) in IgG4-RD than SS and controls (P&lt;0.05). &lt;Conclusion&gt; The results clearly showed that the gene expression pattern in LSG of IgG4-RD is different from that of SS. ","Liver dysfunction and cirrhosis affect vasculature in several organ systems and cause impairment of organ functions, thereby increasing morbidity and mortality. If a mouse model of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) could be established, greater insight into the genetic basis of the disease would be gained. Our objectives were to establish a mouse model of lung injury after common bile duct ligation (CBDL) and to investigate pulmonary pathogenesis for application in future therapeutic approaches. Balb/c mice were subjected to CBDL. Immunohistochemical analyses and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction were performed on pulmonary tissues. The presence of HPS markers were detected by western blot and microarray analyses. We observed extensive proliferation of CD31-positive pulmonary vascular endothelial cells 2 weeks after CBDL, and identified 11 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated proteins that were associated with angiogenesis. MMP-9 protein was highly expressed at 3 weeks after CBDL, and less expressed in lungs of the control group. Contrary to our expectation, lung pathology in our mouse model exhibited differences from that of rat models, and the mechanisms responsible for these differences are unknown. This phenomenon may be explained by contrasting processes related to TNF induction of angiogenic signaling pathways in the inflammatory phase; thus, we suggest that our mouse model can be applied to pulmonary pathological analyses in the inflammatory phase, i.e., to systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute lung injury, and MOD syndrome.","Chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome is an IL-1-driven autoinflammatory disorder caused mainly by NLRP3 mutations. The pathogenesis of CINCA syndrome patients who carry NLRP3 mutations as somatic mosaicism has not been precisely described because of the difficulty in separating individual cells based on the presence or absence of the mutation. Here, we report the generation of NLRP3-mutant and non-mutant induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from two CINCA syndrome patients with somatic mosaicism, and describe their differentiation into macrophages (iPS-MPs). We found that mutant cells are predominantly responsible for the pathogenesis in these mosaic patients because only mutant iPS-MPs showed the disease relevant phenotype of abnormal IL-1β secretion. We also confirmed that the existing anti-inflammatory compounds inhibited the abnormal IL-1β secretion, indicating that mutant iPS-MPs are applicable for drug screening for CINCA syndrome and other NLRP3-related inflammatory conditions. Our results illustrate that patient-derived iPSCs are useful for dissecting somatic mosaicism, and that NLRP3-mutant iPSCs can provide a valuable platform for drug discovery for multiple NLRP3-related disorders.","Molecular signatures to improve diagnosis in PTCL and prognostication in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Gene expression profiling of PTCL patient samples was performed to investigate whether molecular signatures can be used to identify distinct entities of PTCL.","Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html  June 03, 2009: annotation table updated with netaffx build 28 June 08, 2012: annotation table updated with netaffx build 32 June 27, 2016: annotation table updated with netaffx build 35 Protocol: see manufacturer's web site  Based on this UniGene build and associated annotations, the HG-U95Av2 array represents approximately 10,000 full-length genes. ","The goal of this study is to undertake splicing analysis to validate clones derived from K562 cell lines which have been CRISPR engineered to carry mutations frequently observed in hematologic cancers on splicing factor U2af1.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 22 (SCA22) caused by KCND3 mutations is an autosomal dominant disorder. We establish a mouse model carrying the Kcnd3 F227del mutation to study the molecular pathogenesis. Four findings are pinpointed. Firstly, the heterozygous mice exhibit an early onset of defects in motor coordination and balance, which mirror the SCA22 patients. The degeneration and a minor loss of Purkinje cells together with the concurrent presence of neuroinflammation, as well as the previous finding on electrophysiological changes, may all contribute to the development of the SCA22 ataxia phenotype in mice carrying the Kcnd3 F227del mutant protein. Secondly, the mutant protein is retained by the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi leading to activation of the unfolded protein response and a severe trafficking defect that affects its membrane destination. Intriguingly, profound damage to Golgi is the earliest manifestation. Thirdly, transcriptomic analysis revealed that the Kcnd3 F227del mutation down-regulates a panel of genes involved in the functioning of synapse and neurogenesis which are tightly linked to the functioning of Purkinje cells. Finally, no ataxia phenotypes are detectable in knockout mice carrying a loss-of-function Kcnd3 mutation. Thus, the Kcnd3 F227del is a dominant-negative mutation. Additionally, this mouse model can serve as a pre-clinical model for exploring therapeutic strategies to treat patients.","Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is a rare disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, combined immunodeficiency, predisposition to malignancies and high clinical variability. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) profiling may provide information on the pathophysiology of complex rare human diseases as they are involved in numerous biological functions including proliferation, differentiation, and DNA repair. To investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in AT patient samples with the aim of identifying miRNA signatures and correlate these patterns with disease pathogenesis. Twenty AT patients (mean age 17.7 + 9.6 years) were enrolled in the study. Clinical and genetic data were collected. We performed a small RNA-seq analysis in PBMCs and fibroblasts to compare miRNA expression profiles in AT patients and controls, and to identify specific expression signatures for AT. We found 42 differentially expressed (DE)-miRNAs in blood samples and 26 in fibroblasts samples. Three DE-miRNAs, miR-342-3p, miR-30a-5p, and miR-195-5p were validated in further AT samples and their dysregulation was confirmed.We identified for the first time, an AT-associated miRNA signature in blood cells and fibroblast samples obtained from a cohort of AT patients. Several pathways were predicted commonly deregulated, mainly involved in cancer. miRNAs may provide information on AT pathophysiology and tumorigenesis.","Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is a rare disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, combined immunodeficiency, a predisposition to malignancies and high clinical variability. Profiling of microRNAs (miRNAs) may offer insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex rare human diseases, as miRNA play a role in various biological functions including proliferation, differentiation, and DNA repair. To investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in samples from AT patients with the aim of identifying miRNA patterns and to investigate how these patterns are related to the disease. We performed short a small RNA-seq analysis on fibroblasts to compare the miRNA expression profile between AT patients and controls. We identified, an AT-related miRNA signature in blood cells and fibroblast samples collected from a group of AT patients. We also predicted several dysregulated pathways, primarily related to cancer, immune system control or inflammatory processes. The findings suggest that miRNAs may provide insights into the pathophysiology and tumorigenesis of AT and have the potential to serve as useful biomarkers in cancer research.","Dysfunction and loss of motor neurons (MNs) in the brain stem and spinal cord is hypothesized to contribute to premature lethality in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) by affecting the swallowing and breathing. Despite the usefulness of SCA1 mouse models in studying pathogenesis, they have important limitations including species differences and extreme size of repeats in comparison to the repeat length present in adult SCA1 patients. Thus, to study early stages of SCA1 pathogenesis that have been shown to be most therapeutically effective in human cells, we have created a human motor neuron model of SCA1. We differentiated MNs patient and unaffected control-donated iPSCs to assess the effect of mutant ATXN1 on this vulnerable cell population with the goal to provide insight to human cellular pathology in this cell type and facilitate the development of therapies to limit pathogenesis in SCA1.","Aluminum-dependent stoppage of root growth and terminal differentiation depend on a functional DNA damage response pathway comprised of the master cell cycle checkpoint ATR (ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA-MUTATED AND RAD3-RELATED) and p53-like transcription factor SOG1 (SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RADIATION 1). Mutational loss of either results in failure to trigger endoreduplication following Al treatment even in the Al-hypersensitive mutant, als3-1. Transcriptome analyses were used to identify several Al-induced SOG1-regulated targets as candidate mediators of Al-dependent growth arrest including SMR5, SMR7, ERF114 and ERF115. Analysis of these factors either as loss-of-function/silenced mutants or by overexpression in the als3-1 background indicates ERF115, a key transcription factor involved in stem cell niche restoration, is important for the switch from an actively growing root to one that has terminally differentiated. Consistent with this, a putative ERF115 ortholog and other DDR factors from barley are also upregulated following Al exposure, suggesting a conserved role for this ATR-dependent pathway in response to Al. In contrast to other ts show that ERF115 and related family members are important determinants for the switch to endoreduplication in the root tip following Al exposure and a central output of the ATR-mediated pathway in Al response.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG-polyglutamine repeat expansion. Purkinje cells (PCs) are central to the pathology of ataxias, but their low abundance in the cerebellum underrepresents their transcriptomes in sequencing assays. To address this issue, we developed a PC enrichment protocol and sequenced individual nuclei from mice and patients with SCA7. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing in SCA7-266Q mice revealed dysregulation of cell identity genes affecting glia and PCs. Specifically, genes marking zebrin-II PC subtypes accounted for the highest proportion of DEGs in symptomatic SCA7-266Q mice. These transcriptomic changes in SCA7-266Q mice were associated with increased numbers of inhibitory synapses as quantified by immunohistochemistry and reduced spiking of PCs in acute brain slices. Dysregulation of zebrin-II cell subtypes was the predominant signal in PCs of SCA7-266Q mice and was associated with the loss of zebrin-II striping in the cerebellum at motor symptom onset. We furthermore demonstrated zebrin-II stripe degradation in additional mouse models of polyglutamine ataxia and observed decreased zebrin-II expression in the cerebella of patients with SCA7. Our results suggest that a breakdown of zebrin subtype regulation is a shared pathological feature of polyglutamine ataxias.","Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR) is a well-studied p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) interactor in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). TIRR is also an RNA binding protein, however its role in RNA regulation in response to cellular insults is not understood.  Here we show that TIRR binds to specific group of mRNAs in response to DNA damage. TIRR bound transcripts encode for transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription regulators. Furthermore, TIRR modulates the formation of RNA processing bodies (P bodies/PBs), in response to DSBs. TIRR also regulates the formation of the closely related but distinct compartments known as stress granules (SGs) in response to cell stress. Furthermore, TIRR dissociates from 53BP1 in response to sodium arsenite treatment independently of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Protein (ATM) signalling. Finally, TIRR interacts with the nuclear export protein Exportin-1 (XPO1) upon DNA damage. TIRR bound RNA co-localises with PB and SGs and TIRR depletion leads to nuclear RNA retention. This work reveals that TIRR orchestrates mRNA nuclear export, metabolism and storage in PBs/SGs. Hence TIRR regulates RNA mediated DNA damage and cell stress responses independently of its canonical 53BP1 binding role.","Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR) is a well-studied p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) interactor in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs).

AR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates neuronal architecture and promotes axon regeneration; however, whether AR transcriptional functions contribute to disease pathogenesis is not fully understood. Using a differentiated PC12 cell model of SBMA, we identified dysfunction of polyQ-expanded AR in its regulation of neurite growth and maintenance. Specifically, we found that in the presence of androgens, polyQ-expanded AR inhibited neurite outgrowth, induced neurite retraction, and inhibited neurite regrowth. This dysfunction was independent of polyQ-expanded AR transcriptional activity at androgen response elements (AREs). We further showed that the formation of polyQ-expanded AR intranuclear inclusions promoted neurite retraction, which coincided with reduced expression of the neuronal differentiation marker -III-Tubulin. Finally, we revealed that cell death is not the primary outcome for cells undergoing neurite retraction; rather, these cells become senescent. Our findings reveal that mechanisms independent of AR canonical transcriptional activity underly neurite defects in a cell model of SBMA and identify senescence as a previously unappreciated pathway implicated in this pathology. These findings suggest that, in the absence of a role for AR canonical transcriptional activity in the SBMA pathologies described here, the development of SBMA therapeutics that preserve this activity may be desirable. This approach may be broadly applicable to other polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington’s disease and spinocerebellar ataxias.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder caused by a deleterious CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the ataxin-7 gene. The number of CAG repeats determines the severity and age of onset of the disease. Infantile onset SCA7 leads to severe clinical manifestations including dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia and respiratory distress, but the exact cause of respiratory impairment remains unclear. Using the infantile SCA7 mouse model – the SCA7266Q/5Q mouse, we examined the impact of mutant ataxin-7 on the respiratory control centers. Specifically, we examined the effect of pathological poly-Q-ataxin-7 expression on hypoglossal (XII) and phrenic motor units. Further, we identified the transcript profile of the medulla and cervical spinal cord and, investigated the XII and phrenic nerve structure as well as the neuromuscular junctions in the diaphragm and tongue. SCA-7 astrocytes showed significant intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of ataxin-7 in the XII and putative phrenic motor nuclei. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in amino acid and neurotransmitter transportation, and myelination. Additionally, SCA7 mice demonstrated blunted efferent output of the XII nerve and demyelination in both XII and phrenic nerves. Finally, there was an increased number of NMJ clusters with higher expression of synaptic markers in SCA7 mice compared to WT controls. Thus, pathological ataxin-7 expression disrupts myelination and neurotransmitter transportation, and impairs glial cell function in the respiratory control centers. These pre-clinical findings elucidate the underlying pathophysiology responsible for dysphagia, aspiration and respiratory failure in infantile SCA7.","Nucleotide repeat expansion disorders, a group of genetic diseases characterized by the expansion of specific DNA sequences, pose significant challenges to treatment and therapy development. Here, we present a precise and programmable method called prime editor–mediated correction of nucleotide repeat expansion (PE-CORE) for correcting pathogenic nucleotide repeat expansion. PE-CORE leverages a prime editor and paired pegRNAs to achieve targeted correction of repeat sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PE-CORE in HEK293T cells and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Specifically, we focus on spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and spinocerebellar ataxia type, two diseases associated with nucleotide repeat expansion. Our results demonstrate the successful correction of pathogenic expansions in iPSCs and subsequent differentiation into motor neurons. Specifically, we detect distinct downshifts in the size of both the mRNA and protein, confirming the functional correction of the iPSC-derived motor neurons. These findings highlight PE-CORE as a precision tool for addressing the intricate challenges of nucleotide repeat expansion disorders, paving the way for targeted therapies and potential clinical applications.","Analyze Class switch recombination of naïve B-cells in vitro mimicking Ataxia Telangiectasia using a small molecule inhibitor (KU-55933). We measure switched IgG and IgG memory B-cells, and analyzed transcriptomics (this data).","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belonging to a family of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) is pathomechanistically associated with the group of polyglutamine expansion disorders which include SCA 1-3, 6, 7 and 17, and Huntington’s disease. These rare diseases share a common mutational feature that is the expansion of CAG repeat sequence in disease causing genes. These mutations lead to neuronal accumulation of expanded polyglutamine proteins and selective patterns of neurodegeneration. SCA7 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in ATAXIN-7 (ATXN7), a subcomponent of co-activatory transcriptional complex SAGA and primarily affects the cerebellum, retina and brainstem. Currently, only treatments alleviating symptoms are available to patients. Allele-selective lowering of mutant polyQ proteins promises to have high therapeutic outcomes and safety profiles. In this study, PhP.eB  adeno-associated virus (AAV PhP.eB) was used to deliver several shRNAs targeting expanded CAG repeats that were tested for their safety and efficacy to lower the mATXN7 level in the brain. The SCA7140Q/5Q knock-in mice that expresses a mutated Atxn7 allele harboring an expansion of 140 CAG triplet repeats and the wild type mouse allele with 5 CAGs were used in the study. Our SCA7 140Q/5Q KI mouse model remarkably recapitulates cardinal features of SCA7 and bears the potential for pre-clinical trials (Niewiadomska-Cimicka et al., J.Neurosci., 2021). We showed that systemic injection of the AAV-shA4, the most allele-selective and safe reagent of our collection, results in improvement of motor phenotypes as indicated in open field test, and partial correction of transcriptional alterations in the cerebellum of SCA7 mice.","Neurodegeneration in the human population is often associated with loss of protein homeostasis that is driven by accumulation of specific aggregated proteins. Here we investigate whether deficiency in Senataxin, an RNA-DNA helicase associated with cerebellar ataxia and ALS, induces destabilization of intrinsically disordered proteins as we previously found with Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and tissue. We find that Senataxin loss does generate protein aggregates but, unlike in A-T, these are associated with the nucleolus and are independent of oxidative stress and PARP activity. Non-coding RNA expression from the intergenic spacer region of ribosomal DNA is induced in the absence of Senataxin and drives the association and aggregation of many proteins known to be prone to aggregation in neurodegenerative disease. Both non-coding RNAs and protein aggregates are eliminated by overexpression of RNaseH1, implicating RNA-DNA hybrids as the key driver of these outcomes. We find that hybrids are high in the absence of Senataxin at intergenic sites, not at annotated protein-coding genes; these include sites of Senataxin binding in the genome, ribosomal DNA, and peri-centromeric regions. These findings suggest that destabilization of the proteome is driven by Senataxin loss and that RNA-DNA hybrids and non-coding RNAs play a critical role in this process.","Spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) is a rare recessive neurodegenerative syndrome associated with cerebellar atrophy and peripheral neuropathy. It is caused by a homozygous missense mutation in the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase-1 (TDP1) gene (A1478G). resulting in a substitution of histidine for arginine-493 (H493R) in the TDP1 catalytic site, leading to reduced TDP1 activity. How TDP1 H493R mutation promotes the SCAN1 phenotype, which is associated with the death of post-mitotic neurons, is unclear. We have generated models of osteosarcoma U2OS cells homozygous for TDP1 H493R employing the CRISPR-Cas9 technique (2 clones, named “1P” and “3.3”). Here, we have generated transcriptional genome wide profile in order to characterize differences in gene expression that are specific of TDP1-mutated clones.","Spinocerebellar Ataxia Autosomal Recessive 20 (SCAR20) is a rare disorder caused by mutation in the SNX14 gene. The symptoms of the disorder including coarse face, poor or lack of speech, delayed or absent of motor function, and most markedly, cerebella atrophy with Purkinje cell degeneration. SNX14 has been localized to ER and shown to play a vital role in facilitating the formation of lipid droplet and maintaining the lipid saturation balance in cell membrane. Meanwhile, it has also been localized to other subcellular organelles, including lysosome and endo-lysosome, and has been suggested to participate in the autophagy responses. However, the previous researches were performed in vitro or ex vivo, and how disrupted SNX14 led to Purkinje cell degeneration in the SCAR20 cerebella in vivo remained unexplored. Here, we report the first animal model that manifested the SCAR20 symptoms, by introducing a 1bp deletion in Snx14 in mice via CRISPR-Cas9. We performed RNAseq to analyse the pathway changes caused by Snx14 KO.","Spinocerebellar Ataxia Autosomal Recessive 20 (SCAR20) is a rare disorder caused by mutation in the SNX14 gene.

The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. ATXN2 (or Atx2 in insects) functions in translational regulation, mRNA stability, and in the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Previous work has shown that the LSm (Like-Sm) domain of Atx2, which mediates translational activation of some target mRNAs, antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly. Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE) experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein (PABP) interacting, PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation analyses show that structured interactions between Ataxin-2 and PABP additionally help determine protein components of Ataxin-2-associated mRNP granules and contribute to Ataxin-2’s association with stress granules. Finally, in vivo experiments in Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain protects against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both promote degeneration. Taken together the data: (a) lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during different stages of translational control; (b) show how structured and non-structured interactions of Ataxin-2 contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation; and (c) demonstrate that the Ataxin-2 protein contains multiple activities that may respectively prevent or promote neurodegeneration.","Viral variant is one known risk factor associated with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), yet the pathogenesis is largely unknown.  We studied SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant-induced PASC in K18-hACE2 mice. The virus replicated productively, induced robust inflammatory responses in lung and brain tissues, and caused weight loss and mortality during the acute infection.  Longitudinal behavior studies, in surviving mice up to 4 months post-acute infection, revealed persistent abnormalities in neuropsychiatric state and motor behaviors, while reflex and sensory functions recovered over time. Surviving mice showed no detectable viral RNA in the brain and minimal neuroinflammation post-acute infection.  Transcriptome analysis revealed persistent activation of immune pathways, including humoral responses, complement, and phagocytosis, and reduced levels of genes associated with ataxia telangiectasia, impaired cognitive function and memory recall, and neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.  Furthermore, surviving mice maintained potent T helper 1 prone cellular immune responses and high neutralizing antibodies in the periphery for months post-acute infection. Overall, infection in K18-hACE2 mice recapitulates the persistent clinical symptoms reported in long COVID patients.","Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressing neuromuscular disease caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, leading to AR aggregation, lower motor neuron death, and muscle atrophy.

To gain insight into the function of these proteins, we generated and characterized Atxn1L-/- and Atxn1-/- ; Atxn1L-/- double mutant animals. We found that Atxn1L -/- mice have several developmental problems including hydrocephalus, omphalocoele and lung alveolarization defects. These phenotypes are more penetrant and severe in Atxn1-/- ; Atxn1L-/- mice, suggesting that Atxn1 and Atxn1L are functionally redundant. To unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the alveolarization defect in Atxn1-/- mice, we carried out microarray analyses using total lung RNA from WT, Atxn1-/- and Atxn1L-/- mice","Analysis of lung of ATAXIN1-Like-/- (Atxn1L-/-) C57BL/6J mice at P6.

Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating the alveolarization defect. ","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region within the ataxin-3 protein. The mutant protein forms intracellular aggregates in the brain. However, the cellular mechanisms causing toxicity are still poorly understood and there are currently no effective treatments. In this study we show that administration of a rapamycin ester, CCI-779, improves motor performance in a transgenic mouse model of SCA3. CCI-779 inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and hence upregulates protein degradation by autophagy. CCI-779 reduces the number of aggregates seen in the brains of transgenic mice and decreases levels of cytosolic soluble mutant ataxin-3, while endogenous wild-type protein levels remain unaffected. CCI-779 is designed for long-term use in patients and therefore represents a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SCA3. Using this disease model and treatment paradigm we employed a microarray approach to investigate transcriptional changes that might be important in the pathogenesis of SCA3. This approach identified Usp15, which showed expression changes at both the mRNA and protein level. Usp15 levels were also changed in mice expressing another mutant polyglutamine protein, huntingtin. In total we identified 16 transcripts that were decreased in transgenic ataxin-3 mice that were normalised following CCI-779 treatment, as the number of transcripts changed was low and the magnitude of these changes was small we suggest that transcriptional dysregulation may not be an important step in the primary pathogenesis of SCA3. "," To elucidate the pathways involved in the SCA7 retinal degeneration, we used DNA GeneChips and compared the gene expression profiles of the mutant mice (R7E) and the control ones (R7N). We performed these experiments at the onset stage of the disease (3w) as well as on the moderate one (9w) in order to correlate the transcriptional deregulations with the phenotype progression. We also compared the R6/2 mice vs wild type (wt) ones to identify between the deregulated transcripts the ones that were also differentially expressed in the R7E vs R7N mice. These common changes are likely caused by polyQ expansion independently of the protein context.

","Neuroinflammation is a major component in the transition to and perpetuation of neuropathic pain states. Spinal neuroinflammation involves activation of TLR4, localized to enlarged, cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts, designated here as inflammarafts. Conditional deletion of cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 in microglia, leading to inflammaraft formation, induced tactile allodynia in naïve mice. The apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) facilitated cholesterol depletion from inflammarafts and reversed neuropathic pain in a model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in wild-type mice, but AIBP failed to reverse allodynia in mice with ABCA1/ABCG1-deficient microglia, suggesting a cholesterol-dependent mechanism. An AIBP mutant lacking the TLR4-binding domain did not bind microglia nor reversed CIPN allodynia. The long-lasting therapeutic effect of a single AIBP dose in CIPN was associated with anti-inflammatory and cholesterol metabolism reprogramming and reduced accumulation of lipid droplets in microglia. These results suggest a cholesterol-driven mechanism of regulation of neuropathic pain by controlling TLR4 inflammarafts and gene expression program in microglia and blocking the perpetuation of neuroinflammation. ","Background: High density lipoprotein (HDL) protects the artery wall by removing cholesterol from lipid-laden macrophages. However, recent evidence suggests that it might also inhibit atherogenesis by combating inflammation. Methods and Results: To identify potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms, we challenged macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inflammatory microbial ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). HDL inhibited the expression of 33% (301 of 911) of the genes normally induced by LPS, microarray analysis revealed. One of its major targets was the type I interferon response pathway, a family of potent viral immunoregulators controlled by TLR4 and the TRAM/TRIF signaling pathway. Unexpectedly, HDL’s ability to inhibit gene expression was independent of cellular cholesterol stores. Moreover, it was unaffected by downregulation of two ATP-binding cassette transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1, that promote cholesterol efflux. To examine the pathway’s potential in vivo relevance, we used mice deficient in apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, HDL’s major protein. After infection with Salmonella (a Gram-negative bacterium that expresses LPS), apoA-I–deficient mice had 6-fold higher plasma levels of interferon-beta-a key regulator of the type I interferon response than did wild-type mice. Conclusions: HDL inhibits a subset of LPS-stimulated macrophage genes that regulate the type I interferon response, and its action is independent of sterol metabolism. These findings raise the possibility that regulation of macrophage genes by HDL might link innate immunity and cardioprotection.","T cells rely on different metabolic pathways to differentiate into effector or memory cells, and metabolic intervention is a promising strategy to optimize T cell function for immunotherapy. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a nexus between glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, regulating pyruvate conversion either to lactate or acetyl-CoA. Here, we retrovirally transduced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) or pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1), which control PDH activity, into CD8+ T cells to test effects on T cell function. Although PDK1 and PDP1 were expected to influence PDH in opposing directions, by several criteria they induced similar changes relative to control T cells. Seahorse metabolic flux assays showed both groups exhibited increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Both groups had improved primary and memory recall responses following infection with murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68). However, metabolomics using labeled fuels indicated differential usage of key fuels by metabolic pathways. Importantly, after B cell lymphoma challenge the engineered CD8+ T cells produced smaller effector populations in the tumor, resulting in larger tumors and poorer survival compared with control cells. Overall, this study indicates that PDK1 and PDP1 both enhance metabolic capacity, but the context of the antigenic challenge significantly influences the consequences for T cell function.","Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) catalyses the irreversible decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which feeds the tricarboxylic acids cycle. We analysed how the lack of PDH affects Pseudomonas putida metabolism. Inactivating PDH generated a strain that can no longer use compounds whose assimilation converges into pyruvate, including sugars and several amino acids. Compounds generating acetyl-CoA supported growth. Interestingly, inactivation of PDH led to loss of the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) effect that inhibits the assimilation of non-preferred compounds when other preferred ones are also present. P. putida can degrade many aromatic compounds, most of which generate acetyl-CoA, and is a useful bacterium for biotransformation and bioremediation processes. However, the genes involved in these metabolic pathways are frequently inhibited by CCR when substrates such as glucose or mixtures of amino acids are also present. Our results show that the PDH-null strain could efficiently degrade aromatic compounds in the presence of other preferred substrates, a condition in which the wild type strain could not mineralise them. Since lack of PDH limits the assimilation of many sugars and amino acids, and relieved CCR, the PDH-null strain could be useful in biotransformation or bioremediation processes that imply growth with mixtures of preferred substrates and aromatic compounds.","The quiescent center (QC) stem cells of maize (Zea mays L.) roots are highly hypoxic under normal oxygen tension. Despite this state, they are vulnerable to hypoxic stress which causes their degradation with the subsequent inhibition of root growth. These effects are abolished by over-ever-expression of the nitric oxide (NO) scavenger Phytoglobin 1 (ZmPgb1.1) preserving the functionality of the QC stem cells during the stress. Among the metabolic changes occurring in WT QC stem cells under low oxygen are the depletion of starch and soluble sugars, reliance of glycolytic fermentation, and impairment of the TCA cycle through the depressed activity of several enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). This suggests that carbohydrate delivery from the shoot is insufficient to meet the metabolic demand of the QC stem cells during the stress. Atypical hypoxic responses related to the induction of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and accumulation of glycolytic metabolites were also identified.  The preservation of QC stem cells by ZmPgb1.1 was underpinned by extensive metabolic rewiring centered around to the activation of the TCA cycle and the retention of carbohydrate storage products, denoting a more efficient production of energy and diminished demand of carbohydrates under conditions where nutrient transport may be limiting. Overall, this study provides an unprecedented overview of metabolic responses occurring in plant stem cells during oxygen deficiency.","Metastatic uveal melanomas are highly resistant to all existing treatments. To address this critical issue, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, which revealed the LKB1-SIK2 module in restraining uveal melanoma tumorigenesis. Functionally, LKB1 loss enhances proliferation and survival through SIK2 inhibition and up-regulation of the sodium/calcium (Na+/Ca2+) exchanger SLC8A1. This signalling cascade promotes increased level of intracellular calcium and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, two hallmarks of cancer. We further demonstrate that combination of an SLC8A1 inhibitor and a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant promotes enhanced cell death efficacy in LKB1- and SIK2-negative uveal melanoma cells compared to control cells. We also designed an LKB1-deficient prognostic gene signature of patient survival that may be predictive of response to this combination. Our data thus identify not only metabolic vulnerabilities, but also new prognostic markers, thereby providing a therapeutic strategy for particular subtypes of metastatic uveal melanoma.","BHLHE40 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is involved in multiple cell activities including differentiation, cell cycle, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. While there is growing evidence to support the functions of BHLHE40 in energy metabolism, little is known about the mechanism. In this study, we found that BHLHE40 expression was downregulated in cases of endometrial cancer of higher grade and advanced disease. Knockdown of BHLHE40 in endometrial cancer cells resulted in suppressed oxygen consumption and enhanced extracellular acidification. Suppressed pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and enhanced lactated dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was observed in the knockdown cells. Knockdown of BHLHE40 also led to dephosphorylation of AMPKα Thr172 and enhanced phosphorylation of PDHA1 Ser293 and LDHA Tyr10. These results suggested that BHLHE40 modulates PDH and LDH activity by regulating the phosphorylation status of PDHA1 and LDHA. We found that BHLHE40 enhanced AMPKα phosphorylation by directly suppressing the transcription of an AMPKα-specific phosphatase, PPM1F. Our immunohistochemical study showed that the expression of BHLHE40, PPM1F, and phosphorylated AMPKα correlated with the prognosis of endometrial cancer patients. Because AMPK is a central regulator of energy metabolism in cancer cells, targeting the BHLHE40‒PPM1F‒AMPK axis may represent a strategy to control cancer development.","Metformin-induced lactate production can lead to lactate acidosis as life-threatening side effect, whereas lactate in a physiological range might also be involved in the therapeutic effect. How metformin increases systemic lactate concentrations is only partly understood. Since human skeletal muscle has a high capacity to produce lactate, we aim to elucidate the potential contribution of skeletal muscle and the dose-dependent regulation of metformin-induced lactate production in primary human myotubes after 48 h of metformin treatment (16-776 μM). At 78 µM, metformin induced lactate production and glucose consumption. Investigating the cellular redox state by mitochondrial respirometry, we found metformin to inhibit the respiratory chain complex I (776 µM, p&lt;0.01) along with a decreased [NAD+]:[NADH] ratio (776 µM, p&lt;0.001). RNA sequencing and phospho-immunoblot data indicate inhibition of pyruvate oxidation mediated through phosphorylation of PDH complex (39 µM, p&lt;0.01). In vivo in human skeletal muscle, we found pyruvate metabolism altered by exercise and not by metformin. Nonetheless, blood lactate levels in the pre-exercise condition are increased under metformin treatment (p&lt;0.05). Metformin-induced inhibition of pyruvate oxidation combined with altered cellular redox state, both shift the equilibrium of the LDH reaction leading to enhanced lactate production of human myotubes.","The endothelium is a major target of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Exposure of endothelial cells (EC) to proinflammatory stimulileads to an increase in mitochondrial metabolism, however, the function and regulation of elevated mitochondrial metabolism in EC in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines remains unclear. Using high-resolution metabolomics and13C-glucose labeled flux techniques, we demonstrate thatpyruvate dehydrogenase activity (PDH) and tricarboxylic acid cycle flux is elevated in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) in response to overnight (16 hrs) treatment withTNFα (10 ng/mL).Mechanistic studies indicate thatTNFα mediates these metabolic changes via mitochondrial specific protein degradation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4, inhibitor of PDH) by the Lon protease via an NF-κB dependent mechanism. Using RNA sequencing following siRNA mediated knockdown of thecatalytically active subunit of PDH, PDHE1a(PDHA1 gene), we show that PDH fluxcontrols the transcription of approximately one-third of the genes that are upregulated by TNFastimulation. Notably, TNFainduced PDHflux regulates a unique signature of proinflammatory mediators (cytokines and chemokines) but not inducible adhesion molecules.Using metabolomics and ChIP sequencing (H3AcK27), we demonstrate that TNFα induced PDH flux promotes histone acetylation of specific gene sets via citrate accumulation and ATP-citrate lyase activity.Together, these resultsindicate that targeting endothelial glucose oxidation and/or acetyl CoA generation may offer a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of vascular inflammation.","High-throughput sequencing was performed to analyze gene expression profiles of RBE cells after the the inhibition of SQLE or FDFT1 by lentiviruses-mediated shRNA, or RBE cells treated with lycorine hydrochloride.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The chromatin landscape was assessed in effector and memory T-cells obtained from wildtype and pyruvate dehydrogenase knockout mouse. Disruption of the metabolic processes involving pyruvate dehydrogenase can affect T-cell differentiation through epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms.","Modulation of metabolic flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays an important role in T cell activation and differentiation. PDC sits at the transition between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is a major producer of acetyl-CoA, marking it as a potential metabolic and epigenetic node. To understand the role of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in T cell differentiation, we generated mice deficient in T cell pyruvate dehydrogenase E1A (Pdha) subunit using a CD4-cre recombinase-based strategy. Herein, we show that genetic ablation of PDC activity in T cells (TPdh-/-) leads to marked perturbations in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and OXPHOS. Due to depressed OXPHOS, TPdh-/- T cells became dependent upon substrate level phosphorylation via glycolysis.  Due to the block of PDC activity, histone acetylation was reduced, including H3K27, a critical site for CD8+ T cell memory differentiation. Transcriptional and functional profiling revealed abnormal CD8+ memory T cell differentiation in vitro. Collectively, our data indicate that PDC integrates the metabolome and epigenome in memory T cell differentiation. Targeting this metabolic and epigenetic node can have widespread ramifications on cellular function.","Modulation of metabolic flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays an important role in T cell activation and differentiation.

We developed iPS cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two NEDAMSS patients and performed microarray.","Germinal center (GC) B cells undergo cycles of somatic hypermutation and selection, thus increasing their antibody affinity before differentiating into plasma or memory cells. The mechanisms dictating the dynamics of GC B cells are incompletely understood. We show that ablating the Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in GC B cells reduces antibody affinity maturation by impairing GC dynamics, as shown by compromised GC expansion, accumulation of CXCR4- B cells, and increased memory B cell differentiation, partly, at the expense of plasma cell production. Furthermore, PRMT1 distinguishes the subset of GC B cells that reenter the GC dark zone after positive selection, in which it is upregulated by Myc in conjunction with mTORC signaling. PRMT1 opposes mature B cell differentiation, as shown by higher plasma cell differentiation of PRMT1-deficient B cells activated ex vivo, a function co-opted by B cell lymphoma cells, in which PRMT1 expression also correlates with Myc expression and outcome.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the central enzyme connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The importance of PDH function in Th17 cells is unknown. Here, we show that PDH is essential for the generation of a unique glucose-derived citrate pool needed for Th17 cell proliferation, survival and effector function. In vivo, mice harboring a T cell-specific deletion of PDH were less susceptible to developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mechanistically, the absence of PDH in Th17 cells increased glutaminolysis, glycolysis, and lipid uptake in an mTOR-dependent manner. However, cellular citrate remained critically low in mutant Th17 cells, which interfered with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), lipid synthesis and histone acetylation crucial for the transcription of Th17 signature genes. Increasing cellular citrate in PDH-deficient Th17 cells restored their metabolism and function, identifying a metabolic feedback loop within central carbon metabolism that may offer possibilities for therapeutically targeting Th17 cell-driven autoimmunity.","Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the central enzyme connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

To evaluate the role of ACLY or PDH in transcriptional reprogramming. T cell-specific Pdha1 knockout mouse by crossing Pdha1fl/fl mouse with CD4CreERT2 and CD4+ T cells from conditional knockout mice with T cell-specific ablation of Acly (CD4-Cre Aclyfl/fl).","Pyruvate metabolism defects lead to severe neuropathies such as the Leigh syndrome (LS) but the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death remain poorly understood. Here, we unravel a connection between pyruvate metabolism and the regulation of the epitranscriptome that is relevant to LS pathogenesis. We identified the transcription factor E4F1 as a key coordinator of AcetylCoenzyme A (AcCoA) production by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and its utilization as an essential co-factor by the Elongator complex to acetylate tRNAs at the wobble position uridine 34 (U34). E4F1-mediated direct transcriptional regulation of Dlat and Elp3, two genes encoding key subunits of the PDC and of the Elongator complex, respectively, ensured proper translation fidelity and cell survival in the central nervous system (CNS) during mouse embryonic development. Furthermore, analysis of PDH-deficient cells highlighted a crosstalk linking the PDC to ELP3 expression that is perturbed in LS patients.","Sjogren’s Disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive salivary and lacrimal gland dysfunction, inflammation, and destruction, and extra glandular manifestations. The etiology and pathophysiology of SjD are incompletely understood. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for immunological tolerance and although Treg abnormalities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, their role in SjD remains ambiguous.  We here show that Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flFoxp3-Cre (Stim1/Stim2 Foxp3cre) mice develop a SjD-like phenotype, including severe sialadenitis with hyposalivation, lacrimal gland (LG) inflammation with dry eye and corneal damage, increased anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibody levels and interstitial lung disease. At the cellular level, salivary gland inflammation in Stim1/2Foxp3 mice is characterized by infiltration with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which is dominated by a T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 immune response. The changes in gene expression in SGs of mice correlate strongly with transcriptional and epigenetic dysregulation found in SjD patients. Our findings in Stim1/Stim2 Foxp3cre mice provide new evidence for a critical role of Treg cells and IFNγ producing Th1 cells in mediating SjD progression.","Stress granules (SGs) are macromolecular assemblies that form under cellular stress. Formation of these condensates is driven by the nucleation of proteins such as G3BPs. G3BPs are RNA-binding proteins that condense into SGs following translation shutoff during the integrated stress response (ISR). Three G3BP paralogs (G3BP1, G3BP2A, and G3BP2B) have been identified in vertebrates. However, the contribution of the different G3BP paralogs to stress granule formation and stress-induced gene expression changes are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a molecular tool to study G3BP condensation into SGs by mutating residue V11 of G3BPs. This conserved amino acid potentiates the G3BP-Caprin-1 complex, hence promoting SG assembly. Ribosome profiling revealed that disruption of G3BP condensation impacts mRNA levels and ribosome engagement during the ISR. Moreover, we found that G3BP2B preferentially condenses and promotes changes in mRNA expression under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Together, this work suggests that stress granule assembly promotes changes in gene expression under cellular stress, which is differentially regulated by G3BP paralogs.","Stress granules (SGs) are macromolecular assemblies that form under cellular stress.

The RNA components of SGs have been profiled through various approaches, characterized as long, translation-repressed, and highly epigenetically modified. However, it remains unclear whether these RNAs are uniformly distributed within SGs. In this study, we used multiple SG core proteins to genetically target the photocatalyst protein miniSOG, which allows for comprehensive CAP-seq profiling of RNA components within SGs. We discovered that RNAs associated with different SG core proteins exhibit heterogeneous distribution and distinct intrinsic features. Furthermore, we applied CAP-seq to map the RNA components in processing bodies (PBs) under both unstressed conditions and arsenite stimulation. By comparing the SG and PB transcriptomes, our data revealed that m6A modification may promote the localization of RNAs to SGs, while higher AU content may facilitate the targeting of mRNAs to PBs. This suggests potential regulatory roles in determining the subcellular localization of mRNAs within membrane-less organelles.","Blunted first-phase insulin secretion and insulin deficiency are indicators of β-cell dysfunction and diabetes manifestation. Thus, insights into molecular mechanisms that regulate insulin homeostasis might provide entry sites  to replenish insulin content and restore β-cell function. Here, we identify the insulin inhibitory receptor (short: inceptor; encoded by the gene IIR) as an insulin-binding receptor that regulates insulin stores by lysosomal degradation. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived islets, we show that IIR knockout (KO) results in enhanced stem cell (SC)-β-cell differentiation and survival. Strikingly, extended in vitro culture of IIR KO SC-β-cells leads to greatly increased insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). We find that inceptor localises to clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) close to the plasma membrane (PM) and in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), as well as in secretory granules (SGs), where it acts as a sorting receptor to direct proinsulin and insulin towards lysosomal degradation. Targeting inceptor using a monoclonal antibody (mAB) increases proinsulin and insulin content and improves SC-β-cell GSIS.","The binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to genomic enhancers activates gene expression in mammalian cells. However, the molecular details that link enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state, and gene expression levels remain opaque. We applied single-molecule footprinting (SMF) to measure the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes, and components of the transcription machinery on engineered enhancer/promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic and an endogenous TF. We find that activation domains enhance a TF’s capacity to compete with nucleosomes for binding to DNA in a BAF-dependent manner, TF binding on nucleosome-free DNA is consistent with independent binding between TFs, and average TF occupancy linearly contributes to promoter activation rates. We also decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms, which can be tuned and perturbed independently. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the binding microstates observed at the enhancer and subsequent time-dependent gene expression. This work provides a template for quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene activation, including the activity of chromatin remodelers, TF activation domains, chromatin acetylation, TF concentration, TF binding affinity, and TF binding site configuration.","Stress granules (SGs) constitute a signaling hub that plays a critical role in type I interferon responses. Here, we report that growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible beta (Gadd45β) act as a novel positive regulator of SGs-mediated interferon signaling by targeting G3BP upon RNA virus infection. Gadd45β deficiency markedly impairs SG formation and SG-mediated activation of interferon signaling in vitro. Gadd45β knockout mice are highly susceptible to RNA virus infection and their ability to produce interferon and cytokines is severely impaired. Specifically, Gadd45β interacts with the RNA-binding domain of G3BP, leading to conformational expansion of G3BP1 via dissolution of its autoinhibitory electrostatic intramolecular interaction. The acidic loop 1- and RNA-binding properties of Gadd45β markedly increase the conformational expansion and RNA-binding affinity of the G3BP1-Gadd45β complex, thereby promoting assembly of SGs. These findings suggest a role for Gadd45β as a new component and critical regulator of G3BP1-mediated SG formation which facilitates RLR-mediated interferon signaling.","FGF signaling is essential for salivary gland (SG) development and heparan sulfate (HS) regulation of FGFR function is determined by immense structural diversity of sulfated HS domains. The basement membrane (BM), containing HS proteoglycans, collagens and laminins, separates epithelia from stroma and controls growth factor-matrix cross-talk. 3-O-sulfotransferases generate highly 3-O-sulfated HS domains (3-O-HS) and Hs3st3a1 and Hs3st3b1 are enriched in myoepithelial cells (MECs), which produce BM and are a growth factor signaling hub. To investigate 3-O-HS regulation of MEC function and growth factor signaling, we generated Hs3st3a1;Hs3st3b1 double knockout (DKO) mice. The DKO HS loses specific highly 3-O-sulfated tetrasaccharides, which increases FGF/FGFR-complex binding to HS. During development this leads to increased FGFR-, BM- and MEC-related gene expression. However, in adult DKO SGs the secretory units containing acinar and MECs, have reduced MECs, increased BM and disrupted acinar polarity, resulting in salivary hypofunction. We used defined 3-O-sulfated-HS in FGFR pulldown assays and primary organ cultures to investigate 3-O-HS-dependent mechanisms regulating MEC development. We find that 3-O-HS modulates FGFR signaling to regulate MEC BM synthesis which is critical for secretory unit homeostasis and acinar function. Understanding how sulfated HS regulates development will inform the use of HS mimetics in organ regeneration.","FGF signaling is essential for salivary gland (SG) development and heparan sulfate (HS) regulation of FGFR function is determined by immense structural diversity of sulfated HS domains.

However, the existing protocols for inducing SG include limited factors, making it challenging to mimic the in vivo microenvironment of embryonic SGs. We reported a cocktail factor approach to enhance the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived oral epithelium (OE) into SG progenitors through a three-dimensional co-culture method. Upon confirming that the embryonic SG can promote the differentiation of mESC-derived OE, we performed RNA sequence analysis to identify factors involved in the differentiation of SG progenitors. Our findings highlight several efficient pathways related to SG development, with frequent appearances of four factors: IFN-γ, TGF-β2, EGF, and IGF-1. The combined treatment using these cocktail factors increased the expression of key SG progenitor markers, including Sox9, Sox10, Krt5, and Krt14. However, absence of any one of these cocktail factors did not facilitate differentiation. Notably, aggregates treated with the cocktail factor formed SG epithelial-like structures and pre-bud-like structures on the surface. In conclusion, this study offers a novel approach to developing a differentiation protocol that closely mimics the in vivo microenvironment of embryonic SGs. This provides a foundation for generating PSC-derived SG organoids with near-physiological cell behaviors and structures.","Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR) is a well-studied p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) interactor in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). TIRR is also an RNA binding protein, however its role in RNA regulation in response to cellular insults is not understood.  Here we show that TIRR binds to specific group of mRNAs in response to DNA damage. TIRR bound transcripts encode for transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription regulators. Furthermore, TIRR modulates the formation of RNA processing bodies (P bodies/PBs), in response to DSBs. TIRR also regulates the formation of the closely related but distinct compartments known as stress granules (SGs) in response to cell stress. Furthermore, TIRR dissociates from 53BP1 in response to sodium arsenite treatment independently of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Protein (ATM) signalling. Finally, TIRR interacts with the nuclear export protein Exportin-1 (XPO1) upon DNA damage. TIRR bound RNA co-localises with PB and SGs and TIRR depletion leads to nuclear RNA retention. This work reveals that TIRR orchestrates mRNA nuclear export, metabolism and storage in PBs/SGs. Hence TIRR regulates RNA mediated DNA damage and cell stress responses independently of its canonical 53BP1 binding role.","Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR) is a well-studied p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) interactor in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs).

Such interactions result in behaviors such as cell spreading, cell migration, or cell volume expansion, which occur on timescales of hours to days. However, whether cells can deform local niches at shorter timescales and how such interactions impact long-term cell fates remain largely unknown. Here we report “cell dancing”- a previously unknown cell behavior characterized by seconds-to-minutes scale deformation of the pericellular niche and enhanced cytoskeletal and nuclear dynamics. Using hydrogels that allow cells to deform their local 3D niche and mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenesis as a model system, we identify early-stage cell dancing essential for enhancing stem cell differentiation in 3D. This is mediated through nuclear mechanotransduction pathways that repress global chromatin accessibility, which is necessary for cell dancing-enhanced differentiation. We further demonstrate that cell dancing induces nuclear deformations and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) signaling, and small molecules targeting this pathway can further boost stem cell chondrogenesis. Finally, we validate that cell dancing can enhance stem cell differentiation towards multiple lineages and occurs in other commonly used hydrogel systems. These results establish cell dancing as a novel cell behavior in 3D that may be broadly applied to promote desirable cell fates and tissue outcomes.","Some chemotherapy drugs influence the formation of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic RNA foci involved in stress response pathways. The exact role of SGs in promoting cell survival or apoptosis needs further clarification. The chemotherapy drug lomustine induces SG formation by activating the eIF2α kinase HRI (EIF2AK1). We performed a DNA microarray transcriptome analysis to identify genes affected by lomustine-induced stress and to explore the role of SGs. Our findings show that lomustine specifically regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic EGR1 gene. The presence of EGR1 mRNA in SGs correlates with reduced translation of EGR1 mRNA. Lomustine likely sequesters EGR1 mRNA into SGs, preventing its ribosomal translation and thereby limiting apoptosis. This supports a model where SGs selectively sequester specific mRNAs in response to stress, modulate their translation, and thus determine the fate of stressed cells.","Stress granules (SGs) assembly in response to various stress, has been demonstrated in the regulation of anti-viral immune response and tumor progression. However, lack of evidence to illustrate the relation between SGs formation and allergic diseases. Applied G3BP1-RIP-seq in RAW264.7 cells, G3BP1 binding mRNAs are defined.","Stress granules (SGs) assembly in response to various stress, has been demonstrated in the regulation of anti-viral immune response and tumor progression. However, lack of evidence to illustrate the relation between SGs formation and allergic diseases. Applying RNA-seq in primary macrophages  from G3bp1f/f and G3bp1mac-/- mice, differential expressed genes were defined.","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multigenic disorder caused by the loss of seven contiguous paternally expressed genes. Mouse models with inactivation of all PWS genes display 100% lethality within the first postnatal week and have not helped understand the postnatal pathophysiology of this syndrome. Knockout (KO) models for each candidate gene were also generated, but they lack the functional interactions and possible compensatory functions between PWS-related genes. Here, we generated a novel double KO mouse model to explore the effect of a combined deletion of Magel2 and Necdin.","The interchromatin space in the cell nucleus contains various membrane-less nuclear bodies. Recent findings indicate that nuclear speckles, comprising a distinct nuclear body, exhibit interactions with certain chromatin regions in a ground state. Key questions are how this ground state of chromatin-nuclear speckle association is established and what are the gene regulatory roles of this layer of nuclear organization.  We report here that chromatin structural factors CTCF and cohesin are required for full ground state association between DNA and nuclear speckles. Disruption of ground state DNA-speckle contacts via either CTCF depletion or cohesin depletion had minor effects on basal level expression of speckle-associated genes, however we show strong negative effects on stimulus-dependent induction of speckle-associated genes. We identified a putative speckle targeting motif (STM) within cohesin subunit RAD21 and demonstrated that the STM is required for chromatin-nuclear speckle association.  In contrast to reduction of CTCF or RAD21, depletion of the cohesin releasing factor WAPL stabilized cohesin on chromatin and DNA-speckle contacts, resulting in enhanced inducibility of speckle-associated genes. In addition, we observed disruption of chromatin-nuclear speckle association in patient derived cells with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a congenital neurodevelopmental diagnosis involving defective cohesin pathways, thus revealing nuclear speckles as an avenue for therapeutic inquiry. In summary, our findings reveal a mechanism to establish the ground organizational state of chromatin-speckle association, to promote gene inducibility, and with relevance to human disease.","The interchromatin space in the cell nucleus contains various membrane-less nuclear bodies.

To enable in vitro analyses of the cellular and moelcular mechanisms leading to the neurological alterations associated with T21, we created and characterized a panel of genomically diverse T21 and euploid induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from the Coriell Institute for Biomedical Research, and we then differentiated these iPSCs into neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Microarray transcriptomic analyses were performed on this panel of fibroblasts, iPSCs, and NPCs, identifying genes and pathways that were altered in T21 lines relative to euploid as well as genes and pathways in NPCs that showed inter-individual variability.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Tof1/Timeless, protects eukaryotic cells from DNA replication stress as part of the Fork Protection Complex (FPC). Tof1 supports rapid DNA replication, fork pausing, and resolution of DNA topological stress. Here, we show that disruption of FPC function through loss of either Tof1 or Mrc1 results in DNA damage in long replicons. Despite increasing DNA damage in long replicons, loss of either Tof1 or Mrc1 concurrently reduces DNA damage in regions prone to damage caused by DNA topological stress, indicating that the rapid replication promoted by the FPC fosters completing DNA replication at the cost of increased vulnerability to DNA topological stress. Supporting this we find that a tof1 mutation that selectively inhibits DNA topological stress resolution increases DNA damage in contexts prone to DNA topological stress. Our data indicates that the FPC balances rapid replication with recruitment of topoisomerase I to resolve the topological stress generated by increased DNA unwinding.","Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1 (TREX1) gene mutations have been associated with Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS) - a rare, severe pediatric autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the brain and has a poorly understood etiology. Microglia are brain-resident macrophages indispensable for brain development and implicated in multiple neuroinflammatory diseases. However, the role of TREX1 - a DNase that cleaves cytosolic nucleic acids, preventing viral- and autoimmune-related inflammatory responses - in microglia biology remains to be elucidated. Here, we leverage a model of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived engineered microglia-like cells, bulk, and single-cell transcriptomics, optical and transmission electron microscopy, and three-month-old assembloids composed of microglia and oligodendrocyte-containing organoids to interrogate TREX1 functions in human microglia. Our analyses suggest that TREX1 influences cholesterol metabolism, leading to an active microglial morphology with increased phagocytosis in the absence of TREX1. Notably, regulating cholesterol metabolism with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, FDA-approved atorvastatin, rescues these microglial phenotypes. Functionally, TREX1 in microglia is necessary for the transition from gliogenic intermediate progenitors known as pre-oligodendrocyte precursor cells (pre-OPCs) to precursors of the oligodendrocyte lineage known as OPCs, impairing oligodendrogenesis in favor of astrogliogenesis in human assembloids. Together, these results suggest routes for therapeutic intervention in pathologies such as AGS based on microglia-specific molecular and cellular mechanisms.","The highly dynamic regulatory networks involved in brain processes can result in specific gene expression patterns across distinct cell types. The single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics data allow us to better understand these patterns. This study involved the analyses of the brains of mice and  humans with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Down Syndrome.","Studies on MECP2 function and its implications in Rett Syndrome (RTT) have traditionally centered on neurons. Here, using human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines, we modeled MECP2 loss-of-function (LOF) to explore its effects on astrocyte (AST) development and dysfunction in the brain. Ultrastructural analysis of RTT hESC-derived cerebral organoids revealed significantly smaller mitochondria compared to controls (CTR), particularly pronounced in glia versus neurons. Employing a multiomics approach, we observed increased gene expression and accessibility of a subset of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes upon mutation of MECP2 in ASTs compared to neurons. Analysis of hESC-derived ASTs showed reduced mitochondrial respiration and altered key protein in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain in RTT versus controls. Additionally, RTT ASTs exhibited increased cytosolic amino acids under basal conditions, depleted upon increased energy demand. Notably, mitochondria isolated from RTT ASTs exhibited increased reactive oxygen species and influenced neuronal activity when transferred to cortical neurons. These findings underscore MECP2 mutation's differential impact on mitochondrial and metabolic pathways in ASTs versus neurons, suggesting that dysfunctional AST mitochondria may contribute to RTT pathophysiology by affecting neuronal health.","Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare and severe genetic developmental disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and intellectual disability. CREBBP and EP300, the two genes known to cause RTS encode transcriptional coactivators with a catalytic lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activity. Loss of CBP or p300 function results in a deficit in protein acetylation, in particular at histones. In RTS, nothing is known on the consequences of the loss of histone acetylation on the transcriptomic profiles during neuronal differentiation. To address this question, we differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells from RTS patients carrying a recurrent CREBBP mutation that inactivates the KAT domain into cortical and pyramidal neurons. By comparing their acetylome and their transcriptome at different neuronal differentiation timepoints, we identified 25 specific acetylated histone residues altered in RTS. We also identified the transition between neural progenitors and immature neurons as a critical step of the differentiation process, with a delayed neuronal maturation in RTS.","Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare X-linked neurogenetic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and severity of ALD still remain unclear. For mining information on candidate genes associated with onset and severity of ALD, RNA-seq had been executed via using whole blood samples from monozygotic twin families with ALD disease. The information on candidate genes of this research had been considered as the crucial for preliminarily exploring the molecular mechanisms relating to the onset and severity of ALD, which offered novel insights and research directions for mitigating and treating the development of ALD.","Individuals with Down syndrome have a increased likelihood of suffering from inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, due to the presence of four interferon receptors on chromosome 21. Transcription of genes plays a key role in the interferon response, and the Mediator kinases, CDK8 and CDK19, are essential in potentiating this transcription. Given the role CDK8/19 play in the interferon response, and the fact that selective inhibitors of these kinases exist (such as Cortistatin A), it is possible that targetting Mediator kinase activity may alleviate symptoms of chronic inflammation in Down syndrome.","Ribonucleotides are estimated to be the most common non-canonical nucleotides transiently incorporated in DNA. Their presence or failure of their removal can affect genome stability and mutations in factors involved in dNTP pool maintenance or ribonucleotide removal can cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome or promote certain human cancers. Here, we have mapped and quantitated ribonucleotides genome-wide, in nine tissues of wild-type mice. We observed tissue-specific variation in number and base identity of incorporated ribonucleotides and present evidence that a number of genomic features, such as tRNA genes, transcription start sites and G-quadruplexes, can increase the frequency of stably incorporated ribonucleotides in their proximity. Moreover, we present the non-random distribution of incorporated ribonucleotides in mtDNA and identified ribonucleotide hotpots. The study presents a framework to understand the physiological role of ribonucleotides in mammalian DNA.","To identify the targets and functions of SNORD116 snoRNAs, we engineered two different deletions mimicking those seen in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) patients into two distinct human embryonic stem cell lines to control for effects of genetic background. We also introduced an inducible Neurogenin-2 cassette into the safe-harbor AAVS1 locus to enable quick and reproducible differentiation into neurons. We verified wild type and deletion genotypes across both genetic background generated comparable neruons at a gene expression level by comparing them to wild type hESCs. We then performed differential gene expression analysis using data obtained from bulk RNA-sequencing to compare the two distinct deletion types to their isogenic wild type pair and each other.","Loss of functional fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome (FXS) and is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability. FMRP is most notably a translational repressor and is thought to inhibit translation elongation by stalling ribosomes as FMRP-bound polyribosomes from brain tissue are resistant to puromycin and nuclease treatment. Here, we present data showing that the C-terminal non-canonical RNA-binding domain of FMRP is essential and sufficient to induce puromycin-resistant mRNA•ribosome complexes. Given that stalled ribosomes can stimulate ribosome collisions and no-go mRNA decay (NGD), we tested the ability of FMRP to drive NGD of its target transcripts in neuroblastoma cells. Indeed, FMRP and ribosomal proteins, but not PABPC1, were enriched in isolated nuclease-resistant disomes compared to controls. Using siRNA knockdown and RNA-seq, we identified 16 putative FMRP-mediated NGD substrates, many of which encode proteins involved in neuronal development and function. Increased mRNA stability of the putative substrates was also observed when either FMRP was depleted or NGD was prevented via RNAi. Taken together, these data support that FMRP stalls ribosomes and can stimulate NGD in cells, albeit on a small number of transcripts, revealing an unappreciated role of FMRP that would be misregulated in FXS when FMRP is lost.","Fragile X Syndrome is an inherited X-linked disorder associated with intellectual disabilities that begin in childhood and last a lifetime. The symptoms overlap with autism spectrum disorder, and the syndrome predominantly affects males. Consequently, FXS research tends to favor analysis of social behaviors in males, leaving a gap in our understanding of other behavioral traits, especially in females. Here we used a mouse model of FXS to analyze developmental, behavioral, neurochemical, and transcriptomic profiles in males and females. Our behavioral assays demonstrated locomotor hyperactivity, motor impulsivity, increased “approach” behavior in an approach-avoidance assay, and deficits in nest building behavior. Analysis of brain neurotransmitter content revealed deficits in striatal GABA, glutamate, and serotonin content. RNA sequencing of the ventral striatum unveiled expression changes associated with neurotransmission as well as motivation and substance use pathways. Sex differences were identified in nest building behavior, striatal neurotransmitter content, and ventral striatal gene expression. In summary, our study identified sex differences in specific behavioral, neurotransmitter, and gene expression phenotypes and gene set enrichment analysis identified significant enrichment of pathways associated with motivation and drug reward.","Loss of function mutations in MECP2are associated to Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disease. Mainly working as a transcriptional regulator, MECP2 absence leads to gene expression perturbations resulting in deficits of synaptic function and neuronal activity. In addition, RTT patients and mouse models suffer from a complex metabolic syndrome, suggesting that related cellular pathways might contribute to neuropathogenesis. Along this line, autophagy is critical in sustaining developing neuron homeostasis by breaking down dysfunctional proteins, lipids, and organelles. Here, we investigated the autophagic pathway in RTT and found reduced content of autophagic vacuoles in Mecp2 knock-out neurons. This correlates with defective lipidation of LC3B-II probably caused by a deficiency of the autophagic membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine. The administration of the autophagy inducer trehalose recovers LC3B lipidation, autophagosomes content in knock-out neurons, and ameliorates their morphology, neuronal activity and synaptic ultrastructure. Moreover, we provide evidence for attenuation of motor and exploratory impairment in Mecp2 knock-out mice upon trehalose administration. Overall, our findings open new perspectives for neurodevelopmental disorders therapies based on the concept of autophagy modulation.","Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, and through in vivo and in vitro genetic screens, we identified USP1 as an important factor in promoting tumor progression. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome of sh-USP after knockdown with the aim of identifying downstream effectors of USP1","Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is a serious malignant disease of digestive system over the world. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) was a secreted glycoprotein, which involved in multiple pathophysiological process, such as metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, proliferation and metastasis. Nevertheless, the expression, function, and prognostic significance of ANGPTL4 in GC are still contradictory. Methods: Bioinformatic analysis to confirm the expression and prognosis of ANGPTLs in GC. IF staining was used to detect ANGPTL4 protein in GC samples. The molecular biological effect of ANGPTL4 was confirmed by EdU, MTT, FCS, wound healing, transwell, tube formation chorioallantoic membrane model, and nude mice model assay in GC cell lines. RNA-seq was used to confirm the potential downstream mechanism of ANGPTL4, which verified by PCR, WB, IF, co-IP and molecular docking.  Results: ANGPTL4, as an important ANGPTLs, was significantly correlated with poor diagnosis in GC patients. The proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis escaping, angiogenesis ability was enhanced by ANGPTL4 in SNU5 and MKN7, but repressed in AGS. LGALS7 could be upregulated in AGS transfected with ANGPTL4 OE, which was one of the key factors that cause ANGPTL4 to produce an anticancer phenotype. Conclusion: LGALS7 was a key factor for the contradictory effect of ANGPTL4 on activating hedgehog pathway to driving GC progression, including proliferation, migration, apoptosis escaping, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.","Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is an important precancerous lesion in intestinal-type gastric cancer, with persistent Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection inducing the condition. In a previous study, we identified a new H. pylori virulence factor, SlyD. However, its mode of action between GIM was unknown. Our findings offer clues to reveal the molecular mechanism of H.pylori infection-associated gastric intestinal metaplasia, and provides the mechanism of a novel H. pylori virulence factor SlyD in gastric precancerous disease.","Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of pathogen in humans that has infected nearly half of the population worldwide. Infections with H. pylori are typically associated with chronic gastritis and may even lead to gastric and duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. While the mechanisms behind persistent colonization by H. pylori and the development of gastritis associated with it remain unclear, it is generally believed that the gastric epithelial cells (GECs) modulated by H. pylori in the gastric mucosa play a crucial role. We  extensively studied the global gene expression patterns in H. pylori-infected AGS cells, a line of gastric epithelial cells, and identified genes that show increased expression upon infection with H. pylori.","Circular RNA (circRNA) is a type of endogenous single-stranded and covalently closed non-coding RNA that plays emerging roles in tumorigenesis and aggressiveness. However, the functions and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in regulating gastric cancer progression still remain elusive. We identify circ-hnRNPU, a circRNA derived from exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU), as a tumor suppressor of gastric cancer progression. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the functions of circ-hnRNPU, we employed the Illumina HiSeq X Ten as a discovery platform to analyze the transcriptome profiling changes of human gastric cancer MKN-45 and AGS cells in response to stable over-expression of circ-hnRNPU. The results showed that stable over-expression of circ-hnRNPU led to altered expression of 112 human mRNAs, including 64 up-regulated and 48 down-regulated genes, in both MKN-45 and AGS cells. Furthermore, we validated the RNA-seq results by real-time RT-PCR with high identity. Overall, our results provided fundamental information about the transcriptomic changes in response to circ-hnRNPU over-expression in human gastric cancer cells, and these findings will help us understand the pathogenesis of cancer progression.","Gastric cancer (GC) is an asymptomatic malignancy in early stages, with a limited and cost-ineffective diagnostic toolbox that globally contributes to severe mortality rates on an annual basis. Ectopic expression of the lineage survival transcription factors (LS-TFs) GATA 4 and 6 promotes stomach oncogenesis, at the stage of premalignant gastric lesions. However, LS-TFs play important physiological roles that hinder their direct therapeutic targeting, therefore their downstream target genes are of particular interest for developing cancer-specific molecular biomarkers or therapeutic agents. In this work we couple inducible knock-down systems with chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA-seq to thoroughly detect and further characterize direct targets of GATA-mediated transcriptional regulation in gastric cancer cells. Our experimental and computational strategy provides evidence that these transcription factors regulate the expression of several coding and non-coding RNAs that in turn mediate for their cancer-promoting phenotypes. Finally, the prognostic and diagnostic potential of selected target transcripts is evaluated in patient biopsies, emphasizing on gastrointestinal tumors.","Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori), a gastrointestinal pathogen, is known to increase the risk of gastric cancer by activating chronic pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in epithelial cells. Cytotoxin-related protein A (CagA) is known to play an important role in gastric cancer development. CagA has been reported to induce tumors by inducing overexpression of YAP/TAZ, a component of Hippo signaling, and dysregulation of the pathway, thereby promoting cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. However, the role of H.pylori-mediated YAP/TAZ has not yet been fully investigated. Our study aimed to investigate the role of YAP/TAZ in H.pylori-mediated Hippo pathway dysregulation in gastric carcinogenesis using H.pylori-infected gastric cancer cell lines, knockout mice, and patient-derived organoids. CagA-mediated YAP overexpression in gastric epithelial cells induced intestinal epithelial metaplasia and induced intracellular rearrangement of the binding protein ZO1, thereby conferring cell motility. ","Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant health challenge due to its high mortality rate and the limited efficacy of current targeted therapies. A critical barrier in developing more effective treatments is the lack of understanding of specific mechanisms driving GC progression. This study investigates the role of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a non-selective cation channel known for its high Ca2+ permeability and tumor-suppressive properties in gastrointestinal cancers. Specifically, we explore the impact of SUMOylation—a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification—on TRPV1's function in GC. We demonstrate that SUMOylation of TRPV1 inhibits cell proliferation and migration in MGC-803 and AGS gastric cancer cells. By mutating amino acids near TRPV1's existing SUMO motif (slKpE), we created a bidirectional SUMO motif (EψKψE) that enhances TRPV1 SUMOylation, resulting in further suppression of GC cell proliferation and migration. In vivo studies support these findings, showing that TRPV1 SUMOylation prevents spontaneous tumorigenesis in a mouse gastric cancer model. Further investigation reveals that TRPV1 SUMOylation increases the protein's membrane expression by inhibiting its interaction with the adaptor-related protein complex 2 mu 1 subunit (AP2M1). This elevated membrane expression leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ influx, activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which in turn inhibits the proliferation and migration of GC cells. In conclusion, our study elucidates a novel mechanism wherein TRPV1 SUMOylation promotes its membrane expression and activates the TRPV1-Ca2+-AMPK signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting GC cell proliferation and migration. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular dynamics in gastric cancer and could provide a new theoretical basis for clinical treatment strategies.","Background: Zinc finger and scan domain containing 18 (ZSCAN18) belongs to zinc finger transcription factor superfamily, which consists of the hundreds of members that play critical roles in all steps of tumorigenesis. Although hypermethylation of ZSCAN18 promoter and its consequent deficiency in a variety of malignancies has been reported recently, its functions and mechanisms in the initiation and progression of gastric cancer (GC) are not clear. This study aims to investigate the roles of ZSCAN18 in gastric carcinogenesis. Methods: Methylation of ZSCAN18 promoter in GC cell lines were analyzed via MassARRAY and treatment of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, CCK-8, colony formation, and in vivo xenograft tumor model were used to examine the expression and function of ZSCAN18. Survival analysis was performed to determine the correlation between ZSCAN18 expression and prognosis of patients with GC. Genes modulated by ZSCAN18 in NCI-N87 cells were identified through RNA next generation sequence screening and further verified by qRT-PCR in AGS and NCI-N87 cells. Results: ZSCAN18 expression was markedly reduced in GC tissues as compared with that in adjacent normal tissues due to hypermethylation in GC. Likewise, ZSCAN18 expression was also significantly reduced in a panel of GC cell lines as the result of densely methylated ZSCAN18 promoter. Forced expression of ZSCAN18 inhibited proliferation in AGS and NCI-N87 cells in vitro. Additionally, ZSCAN18 impaired growth of NCI-N87 cells in immunodeficient mice. Survival analysis showed that ZSCAN18 expression was positively associated with favorable outcome in patients with GC. RNA next generation sequence screening showed three representative genes (FGF20, CEACAM5 and TP53INP2) involved in downstream signaling pathways modulated by ZSCAN18. Conclusions: Collectively, this study unveils the anti-cancer role of ZSCAN18 in GC, providing a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target.","Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1 (TREX1) gene mutations have been associated with Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS) - a rare, severe pediatric autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the brain and has a poorly understood etiology. Microglia are brain-resident macrophages indispensable for brain development and implicated in multiple neuroinflammatory diseases. However, the role of TREX1 - a DNase that cleaves cytosolic nucleic acids, preventing viral- and autoimmune-related inflammatory responses - in microglia biology remains to be elucidated. Here, we leverage a model of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived engineered microglia-like cells, bulk, and single-cell transcriptomics, optical and transmission electron microscopy, and three-month-old assembloids composed of microglia and oligodendrocyte-containing organoids to interrogate TREX1 functions in human microglia. Our analyses suggest that TREX1 influences cholesterol metabolism, leading to an active microglial morphology with increased phagocytosis in the absence of TREX1. Notably, regulating cholesterol metabolism with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, FDA-approved atorvastatin, rescues these microglial phenotypes. Functionally, TREX1 in microglia is necessary for the transition from gliogenic intermediate progenitors known as pre-oligodendrocyte precursor cells (pre-OPCs) to precursors of the oligodendrocyte lineage known as OPCs, impairing oligodendrogenesis in favor of astrogliogenesis in human assembloids. Together, these results suggest routes for therapeutic intervention in pathologies such as AGS based on microglia-specific molecular and cellular mechanisms.","[Aim] EBVaGC accounts for about 10% of gastric cancer and has a better prognosis than EBVnGC, but its molecular mechanism is still unclear. We investigated the role of EBV-miR-BART1-3p in the occurrence and development of EBVaGC by applying bioinformatics methods, high-throughput sequencing, in vitro experiments, target gene screening and verification, differential gene protein interaction network and gene regulatory network construction. [Materials and Methods] The data set GSE51575 was normalized, and the outlier samples were deleted. Finally, gene expression profiles of 11 EBVaGC and 14 EBVnGC tumor tissues and non-tumor control tissues were obtained. Differential gene function analysis was performed, and molecular regulatory network was constructed. The mRNA expression levels of SNU-719 (EBV-positive gastric cancer cell line), AGS, AGS-NC (EBV-negative gastric cancer cell line) and AGS-OE (lentivirus-transfected miR-BART1-3p overexpression cell line) were detected by high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology, and differential gene expression characteristics were analyzed. To investigate the effect of miR-BART1-3p overexpression on mRNA expression level of gastric cancer cells and construct the protein interaction network of differential genes and the regulatory network of miR-BART1-3p gene. DIANA-MR micro-T, miRnada, miRDB, TarBase v.8, and ViRBase online databases were used to predict the target genes of miR-BART1-3p and GO enrichment analysis of target gene function was performed. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression levels of miR-BART1-3p and target genes in SNU719, AGS-OE and AGS gastric cancer cells. The effects of overexpression of EBV-miR-BART1-3p on proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration of gastric cancer cells were investigated by CCK-8, cell cloning, cell scratch and Transwell. [Results] By analyzing the gene expression profile of the GSE51575 dataset, we found that EBVaGC up-regulated the expression of immune cell membrane protein receptors and chemokine family, and was involved in inducing tumor immunity, suggesting a better prognosis. EBVnGC significantly up-regulated the expression of AURK, BUB1B, CCNA2 and CDC20, suggesting the risk of malignant progression and recurrence. High-throughput next-generation sequencing of SNU719 and AGS to detect differences in gene expression revealed that EBVaGC cells (SNU719) up-regulated the expression of genes that inhibit malignant progression as well as potential tumor immunotherapy targets. These results are consistent with those found in the GSE51575 dataset. Fifteen miR-BART1-3p target genes, including FAM168A, TET3, HBP1, ZBTB5, ATXN7L3, KMT5C, SPARC and BMF, were predicted and screened by online tools. After the overexpression of miR-BART1-3p in AGC(EBVnGC) cells, the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability were significantly inhibited, and the signaling pathway promoting tumor progression was also limited in activation. [Conclusions] The overexpression of miR-BART1-3p may inhibit the proliferation and invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the activation of STAT3/ pSTAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways and may become a target for the treatment of EBVaGC, which is worthy of further study.","ZBTB24-null ICF2 patients suffer from recurrent infections associated with antibody defects, implying a pivitol role of ZBTB24 in B cell biology. We thus generated B-cell specific Zbtb24 knockout mice and investigated its intrinsic role in B cell development and function both in vitro and in vivo. In accordance with findings obtained in ICF2 patients, Zbtb24 is dispensable for B cell developent and maintenance in mice. Strikingly, lack of Zbtb24 does not significantly compromise the primary &amp; secondary antibody responses against TD-Ags, but reduced TID-Ags-elicited antibodies in vivo. At the cellular level, we discovered that Zbtb24-depletion specifically impaires the plasma cell (PC) differentiation of B1, but not the conventional B2 cells comprising follicular and marginal zone B cells, without impacting their survival and proliferation. Mechanistically, ablation of Zbtb24 suppresses the biosynthesis o heme in B1 cells, and supplementation of hemin largely abrogates the differentiation defects of zbtb24-null B1 cells in vitro. Our study not only provides a plausible explanation for the recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in ICF2 patients, but is also relevant for other B1 cell-mediated barrier defenses and immune regulations.","ZBTB24-null ICF2 patients suffer from recurrent infections associated with antibody defects, implying a pivitol role of ZBTB24 in B cell biology.

Transcriptional sequencing data were used to find that KPNA2 primarily regulated alternative 5' splice site (A5SS), alternative 3'splice site (A3SS), exon skipping (ES) and cassette exon. Vitally, KPNA2 was involved in the transcriptional regulation of cancer-related genes. Therefore, we screened potential targets in AGS cells with differential expression and alternative splicing (AS) levels regulated by KPNA2, further identifying that KPNA2 was engaged in biological processes concerning immune response, cell proliferation and apoptosis in GC through transcriptional regulation. Besides, the binding sites of KPNA2 to spliceosomes were identified using improved RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing techniques, and KPNA2 was preferentially bound to the intron region. Notably, KPNA2 regulated the A3SS AS mode of WDR62, which may increase the malignancy of GC. Finally, we also discovered that AS of immune-related molecules can be regulated by KPNA2.

The disease is commonly associated with additional neurodevelopmental, neurological and neuropsychiatric features. Currently, there are no disease-specific treatments for this condition, resulting in significant morbidity and risk of premature mortality. To investigate the underlying disease mechanisms in childhood-onset DNAJC6 parkinsonism, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from three patients harboring pathogenic loss-of-function DNAJC6 mutations and subsequently developed a midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuronal model of disease. DNAJC6 encodes auxilin, a co-chaperone protein involved in clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling at the presynaptic terminal. When compared to age-matched and CRISPR-corrected isogenic controls, the neuronal cell model revealed disease-specific auxilin deficiency as well as disturbance of synaptic vesicle recycling and homeostasis. We also observed dysregulation of key neurodevelopmental pathways affecting ventral midbrain pattering and neuronal maturation.","SVA retrotransposons remain active in humans and contribute to individual genetic variation. Polymorphic SVA alleles harbor gene-regulatory potential and can cause genetic disease. However, how SVA insertions are controlled and functionally impact human disease is unknown. Here, we dissect the epigenetic regulation and influence of SVAs in cellular models of X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an SVA insertion at the TAF1 locus. We demonstrate that the KRAB zinc finger protein ZNF91 establishes H3K9me3 and DNA methylation over SVAs, including polymorphic alleles, in human neural progenitor cells. The resulting mini-heterochromatin domains attenuate the cis-regulatory impact of SVAs. This is critical for XDP pathology; removal of local heterochromatin severely aggravates the XDP molecular phenotype, resulting in increased TAF1 intron retention and reduced expression. Our results provide unique mechanistic insights into how human polymorphic transposon insertions are recognized, and their regulatory impact constrained by an innate epigenetic defense system.","The predominantly function of THAP1 has been defined as a transcription factor, but how it regulates gene expression in human neurons is not well understood.

DRPLA is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the ATN1 gene. The expanded CAG repeats are unstable, and ongoing repeat expansions contribute to disease onset, progression and severity. Previously, we characterized a small molecule, naphthyridine–azaquinolone (NA), which binds to CAG slip-out structures and induces repeat contraction in Huntington’s disease mice. Here, we demonstrate that long-term intracerebroventricular infusion of NA leads to repeat contraction in a murine model of DRPLA. To identify the effects of NA on transcriptional regulation, we conducted comprehensive gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in striatum from PBS-treated and NA-treated DRPLA mice.","We compared the DNA methylation patterns in blood from individuals with two rare neurodevelopmental disorders (Childhood-onset dystonia (DYT-KMT2B) and Kabuki syndrome) and healthy control samples","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The Shieldin complex, consisting of SHLD1, SHLD2, SHLD3 and REV7, shields double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) from nucleolytic resection. The end-protecting activity of Shieldin promotes productive non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in G1 but can threaten genome integrity during S-phase by blocking homologous recombination (HR). Curiously, the penultimate Shieldin component, SHLD1 is one of the least abundant mammalian proteins. Here, we report that the transcription factors THAP1, YY1 and HCF1 bind directly to the SHLD1 promoter, where they cooperatively maintain the low basal expression of SHLD1. Functionally, this transcriptional network ensures that SHLD1 protein levels are kept in check to enable a proper balance between end protection and end resection during physiological DSB repair. In the context of BRCA1 deficiency, loss of THAP1 dependent SHLD1 expression confers cross resistance to PARP inhibitor and cisplatin, and shorter progression free survival in ovarian cancer patients. In contrast, loss of THAP1 in BRCA2 deficient cells increases genome instability and correlates with improved responses to chemotherapy. Pathogenic THAP1 mutations are causatively linked to adult-onset torsion dystonia type 6 (DYT6) movement disorder, but the critical disease targets are unknown. We further demonstrate that murine models of Thap1-associated dystonia show reduced Shld1 expression concomitant with elevated levels of unresolved DNA damage in the brain. In summary, our study provides the first example of a transcriptional network that directly controls DSB repair choice and reveals a previously unsuspected link between DNA damage and dystonia.","The Shieldin complex, consisting of SHLD1, SHLD2, SHLD3 and REV7, shields double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) from nucleolytic resection.

Affected pups exhibited clinical signs of a severe tetraparesis, dystonia, cramping and falling over when trying to walk. In most cases the presentation deteriorated within weeks and elective euthanasia was performed. Pedigree analysis indicated autosomal recessive inheritance. Genome-wide association and homozygosity mapping of 5 affected dogs from 3 litters identified the associated locus on chromosome 31 in the region of SOD1. The DNA sequence analysis of SOD1 showed that the patients were homozygous for a frameshift mutation in the fourth codon. None of the other analyzed dogs of the breed was homozygous for the mutation, indicating full penetrance of the genetic defect. Mutations in SOD1 are known to cause recessive degenerative myelopathy in middle-aged dogs with low penetrance and dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in humans with variable age of onset. Our findings are similar to recent observations in human patients that a loss of function mutation in SOD1 leads to a juvenile neurologic disease distinct from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Single-cell RNAseq (10x Genomics) analysis of human CD4+ T cells in IPEX patients, healthy donors and heterozygous mothers (blood). Human CD4+T cells from IPEX, HD and mothers were isolated from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells by flow cytometry as DAPI–CD3+CD4+ cells. In cohort 1, cells from separate donor were encapsulated in separate channel following 10x Genomics Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit (V2 chemistry). In cohort 2, samples were tagged using a different Hashtags, pooled and encapsulared following 10x Genomics Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit (V3 chemistry).","Natural mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation plays a fundamental role in human disease and enables the clonal tracing of native human cells. While various genotyping approaches revealed mutational heterogeneity in human tissues and single cells, current methodologies are limited by scale. Here, we introduce a high-throughput, droplet-based mitochondrial single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (mtscATAC-seq) protocol and computational framework that facilitate high-confidence mtDNA mutation calling in thousands of single cells. Further, the concomitant high-quality accessible chromatin readout enables the paired inference of individual cell mtDNA heteroplasmy, clonal lineage, cell state, and accessible chromatin regulatory features. Our multi-omic analyses reveals single-cell variation in heteroplasmy of a pathologic mtDNA variant (m.8344A&gt;G), which we tie to intra-individual chromatin variability and clonal evolution. Further, using somatic mtDNA mutations, we clonally trace thousands of hematopoietic cells in vitro and in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, linking epigenomic variability to subclonal evolution in vivo. ","We identified a novel N1-methyladenosine (m1A) modification in tRNALys with distinct effects on the synthesis and stabilities of the 13 mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, we observed regulated RNA modifications of mitochondrial tRNAs for the control of mitochondrial gene expression. Collectively, our data provide unprecedented insight into the regulation of mitochondrial tRNAs and reveal greater complexity to the molecular pathogenesis of MERRF.","Transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into induced Neuronal cells (iNs) by neuronal-specific transcription factors Brn2, Myt1l and Ascl1 is a paradigmatic example of inter-lineage conversion across epigenetically distant cells. Despite tremendous progress on the transcriptional hierarchy underlying transdifferentiation, the enablers of the concomitant epigenome resetting remain to be elucidated. Here we investigated the role of KMT2A and KMT2B, two histone H3 lysine 4 methylases with cardinal roles in development, through individual and combined inactivation. We found that Kmt2b, whose human homologue’s mutations cause dystonia, is selectively required for iN conversion through the suppression of the alternative myocyte program and the induction of neuronal maturation genes.","Transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into induced Neuronal cells (iNs) by neuronal-specific transcription factors Brn2, Myt1l and Ascl1 is a paradigmatic example of inter-lineage conversion across epigenetically distant cells.

Its many forms are genetically, phenotypically and etiologically diverse and it is unknown whether their pathogenesis converges on shared pathways. Mutations in THAP1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, cause DYT6, but its neuronal targets and functions are unknown. We used RNA-Seq to assay the in vivo effect of a heterozygote Thap1C54Y or Exon2 allele on the gene transcription signatures in neonatal mouse striatum and cerebellum. Enriched pathways and gene ontology terms include eIF2α Signaling, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Neuron Projection Development, Axonal Guidance Signaling, and Synaptic Long Term Depression pathways, which are dysregulated in a genotype and tissue-dependent manner. Electrophysiological and neurite outgrowth assays confirmed the functional significance of those findings. Notably, several of these pathways were recently implicated in other forms of inherited dystonia, including DYT1. We conclude that dysfunction of these pathways may represent a point of convergence on the pathogenesis of unrelated forms of inherited dystonia.","Loss of function mutations in the transcription factor THAP1 cause DYT6 dystonia, a childhood-onset motor disorder. DYT6 subjects display abnormalities in the white matter regions of the brain. Here, we generated conditional THAP1 knockout mice and analyzed the gene expression profiles from motor regions of mice brains to identify a role for THAP1 in the control of myelination","The tongue facilitates vital activities such as swallowing. Swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) are common in the elderly and in many adult-onset neuromuscular diseases. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), dysphagia is often the first symptom. OPMD is an autosomal dominant myopathy caused by a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the gene encoding PABPN1. The expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble nuclear aggregates that reduce the levels of the soluble form. Clinical tongue involvement in OPMD has been documented but is poorly understood. Tongue histopathology was investigated in OPMD mouse models using light and electron microscopy. Muscle histopathology was predominantly affected by age. PABPN1 nuclear aggregates were found at moderate levels, whereas deposition of insoluble PABPN1 in blood vessels was already prominent in 4-month-old mice. RNA signatures of the OPMD tongue were enriched for mitochondrial and cytoskeletal genes, suggesting an energy and contractile deficit.  ","Astrocytes promote neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) through cell-intrinsic activities, and also via their ability to recruit and activate other cell types. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide CRISPR-based forward genetic screen investigating regulators of astrocyte proinflammatory responses, which identified CLEC16A, a gene linked to MS susceptibility, as a suppressor of NF-B signaling. Gene and small molecule perturbation studies in mouse primary and human embryonic stem cell-derived astrocytes in combination with multi-omic analyses established that CLEC16A promotes mitophagy, limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and the accumulation of mitochondrial products that activate NF-κB, the NLRP3 inflammasome and gasdermin D. Astrocytespecific Clec16a inactivation increased NF-κB, NLRP3 and gasdermin D activation in vivo, worsening experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS. Moreover, we detected disrupted mitophagic capacity and gasdermin D activation in astrocytes in samples from individuals with MS. These findings identify CLEC16A as a suppressor of astrocyte pathologic responses and a candidate therapeutic target in MS.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a promising immunotherapy against cancer. Although there is a growing interest in other cell types, a comparison of CAR immune effector cells in challenging solid tumor contexts is lacking. Here, we compare mouse and human NKG2D-CAR expressing T cells, NK cells and macrophages against glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumor. In vitro we show that T cell cancer killing is CAR-dependent, whereas intrinsic cytotoxicity overrules CAR-dependence for NK cells and CAR macrophages reduce glioma cells in co-culture assays. In orthotopic immunocompetent glioma mouse models, systemically administered CAR T cells demonstrate superior accumulation in the tumor and each immune cell type induces distinct changes in the tumor microenvironment. An otherwise low therapeutic efficacy is significantly enhanced by co-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in all CAR immune effector cells, underscoring the necessity for multifaceted cell engineering strategies to overcome the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide1,2. HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulated progressive driver mutations3, with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin2. However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is independent of the underlying aetiologies4.  Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations5,6. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC7. We generated over twenty-five new genetically-driven in vivo and in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance, and metastasis to distant organs. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human-mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with histopathology.  In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard of care treatment and used a linked in vitro-in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not been linked to HCC treatment before. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard of care therapy.","Increased levels of the protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn) are associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). In physiological conditions, α-syn modulates synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and neuronal survival. Here, we used a PD patient specific midbrain organoid model derived from induced pluripotent stem cells harboring a triplication in the SNCA gene to study PD-associated phenotypes. The model recapitulates the two main hallmarks of PD, which are α-syn aggregation and loss of dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, impairments in astrocyte differentiation were detected. Transcriptomics data indicate that synaptic function is impaired in PD specific midbrain organoids. This is further confirmed by alterations in synapse number and electrophysiological activity. We found that synaptic decline precedes neurodegeneration. Finally, this study substantiates that patient specific midbrain organoids allow a personalized phenotyping, which make them an interesting tool for precision medicine and drug discovery. However, its pathogenic accumulation and aggregation results in toxicity and neurodegeneration.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide.

How such altered vascular and flow condition affect endothelial cells, the cellular unit of blood vessels, is not known. We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze the heterogenity in endothelial cell clusters in brain, and how key cellular and signaling signatures of these clusters are temporally changed post-TBI at the site of injury.","Analysis of human peritumoral brain following a low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPU) mediated opening of the blood brain barrier, to enhance the delivery of systemic chemotherapies (paclitaxel or carboplatin).","Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a challenging malignancy with dismal prognoses despite aggressive treatment regimens. Intratumoral heterogeneity contributes to therapeutic resistance, with roles for stem cell-like brain tumor initiating cells (GBMs), glioma associated macrophages (GAMs), and communication between them. GAMs are derived from infiltrating lymphocytes, and monocyte migration is increased by GBM cell release of extracellular vesicles, including exosomes. GBM survival is promoted by the glucose transporter GLUT3, which was recently shown to alter macrophage activation states. We found that GBM-derived exosomes contain GLUT3 and that exosomes from GLUT3 expressing GBMs significantly increased monocyte migration in comparison to controls. Monocytes transfected with GLUT3 (but not GLUT1) also had significantly increased migration, demonstrating a direct role for GLUT3 in monocytes migration. Analysis of the transcriptome of exosome treated monocytes demonstrated that exosomes derived from GLUT3 expressing GBMs increasedGDF-15in monocytes. GDF-15 is a known regulator of monocyte migration, and we determined that knockdown of GDF-15 blocked the migration induced by GBM-derived exosomes. As GDF-15 induced monocyte migration is thought to involve MMP12, we next evaluated MMP12 as a potential mediator of the pro-migratory phenotype.MMP12was significantly increased in monocytes upon treatment with exosomes derived from GLUT3 expressing GBMs as was MMP12 activity. Together, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which GBMs facilitate immune evasion and tumor progression: GBM-derived exosomes transfer GLUT3 to monocytes to increase a GDF-15/MMP12 pathway that promotes monocyte migration. The data also highlight the importance of understanding and targeting cell-cell interactions to improve glioblastoma treatment.","Compared to patients with no TBI history, patients with a TBI history at least one month before infectious encephalitis have an increased risk of mortality, epilepsy, and dementia or delirium. Those with a history of TBI have an increased risk of various outcomes, including mortality, epilepsy, and dementia. Bulk RNA sequencing of the hippocampus from mice subjected to CCI injury and VEEV infection demonstrated that key pathways, specifically those involved in granzyme-mediated cell death, were enriched compared to VEEV infection alone.","Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) was previously identified as a regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs). Elucidating the GCH1/Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway in BTICs has unveiled the necessity for GCH1 to protect BTICs from lipid peroxidation. Within this study, we observed differences in lipid pathways and lipid metabolites during GCH1 modulation. Alteration to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), a species of oxidatively vulnerable lipids, were altered during GCH1 knockdown. Pharmacological inhibition of BH4 with drugs known to cross the blood brain barrier (sulfasalazine and pyrimethamine) successfully reduced growth in GCH1 overexpressed BTICs, induced lipid peroxidation.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a progressive cancer with only about 12 % of a 5-year survival rate. PDAC generally shows strong chemoresistance, which has been correlated with the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDAC consisting of various types of stromal cells. Recent single-cell RNA sequence (scRNAseq) analyses demonstrate that a high percentage of myeloid cells in TME stroma cells is related to poor prognosis, and, among myeloid cells, tumor associated macrophages (TAM) are the most abundant population. However, their functions in PDAC malignancy remain largely unknown. Previously, we established a PDAC-organoid associated with an artificial TME by co-culturing patient-derived cancer cells, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived mesenchymal and endothelial cells, which is called fused pancreatic cancer organoid (FPCO). Here, we further incorporated macrophages into FPCO and named it M0-FPCO. After 1 week of organoid culture, the macrophages in M0-FPCO expressed the conventional markers of M2-macrophages, such as CD163 and CD206. However, bulk RNAseq analysis showed that macrophages in M0-FPCO (FPCO-Mac) have distinct characteristics as compared with M2-macrophages induced with IL4 and 13. scRNAseq of M0-FPCO further demonstrated that FPCO-Mac was divided into 6 populations including Granulin+-TAM and SPP1+-TAM, which had been identified in human PDAC tissue. Furthermore, the number of PDAC cells was reduced in FPCO but not in M0-FPCO between 1 and 2 weeks of organoid culture, suggesting that cancer cells could survive longer or are protected from cell death in the presence of TAM. Moreover, the bulk-RNAseq analysis of the surviving M0-FPCO unveiled a GALE potentially associated with a worse prognosis in PDAC patients. Our novel PADC organoid including macrophage (M0-FPCO) replicated the PDAC-TAM features and elucidated their protumorigenic function.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a progressive cancer with only about 12 % of a 5-year survival rate.

Furthermore, the number of PDAC cells was reduced in FPCO but not in M0-FPCO between 1 and 2 weeks of organoid culture, suggesting that cancer cells could survive longer or are protected from cell death in the presence of TAM. Moreover, the bulk-RNAseq analysis of the surviving M0-FPCO unveiled a GALE potentially associated with a worse prognosis in PDAC patients. Our novel PADC organoid including macrophage (M0-FPCO) replicated the PDAC-TAM features and elucidated their protumorigenic function.","Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Recent advances in gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/CasRx, have opened new avenues for therapeutic interventions. In this study, we explored the efficacy of CRISPR/CasRx, which can specifically and accurately digest single-stranded RNA and down-regulate the expression of related genes, in targeting the HTT mRNA and its potential as a treatment strategy for HD. Our results showed that CRISPR/CasRx could significantly down-regulate HTT mRNA in different models, including human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, HD140Q-knockin (HD 140Q-KI) mice at various disease stages, and Huntingtin knockin (HD-KI) pigs, and lead to a subsequent decrease in the expression of mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) protein. Moreover, this intervention could significantly ameliorate the neurological symptoms in HD 140Q-KI mice and HD-KI pigs. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the RNA-targeting CRISPR/CasRx as a potential therapeutic strategy for HD. Furthermore, the success of this approach provides valuable insights and novel avenues for the treatment of other genetic disorders caused by gene mutations.","Anoikis resistance or evasion of cell death triggered by cell detachment is a hallmark of cancer that is concurrent with cell survival and metastasis. Phenotypes of anoikis resistant cancer cells have been extensively investigated, however, how exposure to suspension stress may lead to acquisition of a anoikis resistance phenotype has not been previously described in detail.  Here we show using a spectrum of ovarian cancer cells, that cycles of suspension stress followed by attached growth, leads to adaptation and acquisition of resistance to cell death in suspension . Comparing the stepwise transcriptomic changes as cells acquire resistance, we find strong transcriptional reprogramming in the population with a majority of differentially expressed genes being downregulated during progressive acquisition of anoikis resistance. Adapted anoikis resistant cells display an enhanced dependency on oxidative phosphorylation and are capable of evasion from T cell-mediated immune surveillance. We find that such acquired anoikis resistance is not genetic. However, transcriptional reprogramming is essential to this process as acquisition of such adaptive anoikis resistance invitro and invivo are both exquisitely sensitive to specific inhibition of transcriptional reprogramming. Our data demonstrate that recovery from the verge of anoikis leads to adaptation that promotes metastasis in ovarian cancer, but can be therapeutically prevented by specific inhibitors to transcriptional reprogramming.","Characterisation of the impact of ageing on the peripheral immune response in EAE","Background: Effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains an unmet need. Thus, identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at high-risk of progressing to AD is crucial for early intervention. Methods: Blood-based transcriptomics analyses were performed using a longitudinal study cohort to compare progressive MCI (P-MCI, n=28), stable MCI (S-MCI, n=39), and AD patients (n=49). Statistical DESeq2 analysis and machine learning methods were employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and develop prediction models. Results: We discovered a remarkable gender-specific difference in DEGs that distinguish P-MCI from S-MCI. Machine learning models achieved high accuracy in distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI (AUC 0.93), AD from S-MCI (AUC 0.94), and AD from P-MCI (AUC 0.92). An 8-gene signature was identified for distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI.","This project aims to assess the transcriptomic signature of FUS∆NLS/+ (FUS) vs FUS+/+ (WT) mice, by identifying differentially expressed genes in basal conditions and also during learning. Cytoplasmic mislocalization of the nuclear Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) protein is associated to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Cytoplasmic FUS accumulation is recapitulated in the frontal cortex and spinal cord of heterozygous Fus∆NLS/+ mice. We show that in these mice, the hippocampus, a critical structure involved in learning and memory, paradoxically displays nuclear FUS accumulation. FUS binds to a set of genes characterized by the presence of an ETS/ELK-binding motifs, and involved in RNA metabolism, transcription, ribosome/mitochondria and chromatin organization. Importantly, hippocampal nuclei showed a decompaction of the neuronal chromatin at highly expressed genes and an inappropriate transcriptomic response was observed after spatial training of Fus∆NLS/+ mice. Furthermore, these mice lacked precision in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory task. These studies shows that mutated FUS affects epigenetic regulation of the chromatin landscape in hippocampal neurons, which could participate in FTD/ALS pathogenic events.","Despite advances in clinical diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma (OS) remains poor, and the treatment efficacy has plateaued. Therefore, it is important to identify new therapeutic targets for OS. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been reported to participate in tumor malignancy. In this study, functional screening found that the m6A demethylase FTO could be a candidate therapeutic target for OS. Upregulated FTO in OS could predict a poorer prognosis. FTO promoted the growth and metastasis of OS in vitro and in vivo. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed to identify DACT1 as a potential target of FTO. In vitro assays demonstrated that FTO could reduce the mRNA stability of DACT1 via m6A demethylation, which decreased DACT1 expression and further activated the Wnt signaling pathway. The oncogenic effect of FTO on OS was dependent on DACT1. In addition, the m6A reader IGF2BP1 was validated to participate in the regulation of DACT1. Entacapone, a conventional drug for Parkinson's disease, was confirmed to suppress OS via m6A-mediated regulation through the FTO/DACT1 axis. Our findings demonstrate that FTO may be a novel therapeutic target and that entacapone has the preclinical value to be repurposed for OS.","Metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the inflammatory stage of MASLD, will soon be one of the primary causes of liver-related complications, including advanced fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its steady increase in both the US and the global population is devastating. Between the two genders, more women are suffering from MASH compared to the man due to estrogen deficiency caused by polycystic ovary syndrome or menopause. Our published data shows a clear positive association between the progression of liver disease and the expression of novel hexokinase HKDC1 in the liver. Targeting HKDC1, which is highly expressed in pathological hepatocytes (in MASH) but negligible in normal hepatocytes, represents a highly selective approach. Therefore, we hypothesized that liver-specific deletion of HKDC1 will protect against diet-induced obesity and the progression of MASH to fibrosis. We used an early-onset liver knockout (LKO) of HKDC1 by crossing HKDC1 floxed mice with Albumin Cre mice to test our hypothesis. We fed the Western Diet to HKDC1LKO female mice along with HKDC1 floxed mice (HKDC1fl/fl; as Controls) for 28 weeks. Our data shows that HKDC1 deletion significantly decreases body weight and fat mass compared to HKDC1fl/fl mice with no changes in food intake and energy expenditure. Knockout mice have better glucose tolerance and lower fasting glucose levels than HKDC1fl/fl mice. Our data also shows that the knockout group has smaller livers, healthier liver parameters, less steatosis, and lower NAS and fibrosis scores. Furthermore, HKDC1 knockout alters hepatic gene expression, and we found significantly low proinflammatory and profibrogenic gene expression in the LKO mice. Although we did not see any changes in triglyceride levels, there was a significant reduction of serum cholesterol concomitant with enhanced expression of cholesterol metabolism genes in the knockout group. Our data suggest a promising protective role of HKDC1 deletion against diet-induced obesity and MASH mice.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 22 (SCA22) caused by KCND3 mutations is an autosomal dominant disorder. We establish a mouse model carrying the Kcnd3 F227del mutation to study the molecular pathogenesis. Four findings are pinpointed. Firstly, the heterozygous mice exhibit an early onset of defects in motor coordination and balance, which mirror the SCA22 patients. The degeneration and a minor loss of Purkinje cells together with the concurrent presence of neuroinflammation, as well as the previous finding on electrophysiological changes, may all contribute to the development of the SCA22 ataxia phenotype in mice carrying the Kcnd3 F227del mutant protein. Secondly, the mutant protein is retained by the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi leading to activation of the unfolded protein response and a severe trafficking defect that affects its membrane destination. Intriguingly, profound damage to Golgi is the earliest manifestation. Thirdly, transcriptomic analysis revealed that the Kcnd3 F227del mutation down-regulates a panel of genes involved in the functioning of synapse and neurogenesis which are tightly linked to the functioning of Purkinje cells. Finally, no ataxia phenotypes are detectable in knockout mice carrying a loss-of-function Kcnd3 mutation. Thus, the Kcnd3 F227del is a dominant-negative mutation. Additionally, this mouse model can serve as a pre-clinical model for exploring therapeutic strategies to treat patients.","Objective: Cytokines produced by epithelial and immune cells can act upon one another to promote mucosal healing- a process that goes awry with chronic inflammation as in inflammatory bowel disease. TNFSF13 is a cytokine important for B cell function, but its role in epithelial cell behavior and contribution to inflammatory bowel disease is poorly understood.  Design: We performed histological and functional assays, single cell transcriptomics, and imaging mass cytometry on tissue-derived colonoids or biopsies from a patient with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) harboring a novel TNFSF13 variant. To confirm causal, variant-driven phenotypes, parallel experiments were performed in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)- derived colon organoids engineered with the same TNFSF13 variant.  Results: TNFSF13 variant colonoids exhibited reduced TNFSF13 expression associated with increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis, which was confirmed in iPSC-derived colon organoids. Single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry defined FAS as the predominant colonic epithelial receptor for TNFSF13. TNFSF13 variant colon biopsies demonstrated a shift in tissue B cell populations consistent with altered differentiation of memory B cells. Finally, imaging mass cytometry revealed an increase in epithelial-associated B cells in TNFSF13 variant colon tissue sections compared to healthy and non-monogenic VEO-IBD controls.  Conclusions: The current study defines a previously unknown role for the cytokine TNFSF13 as a regulator of colonic epithelial proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, this study suggests that variant TNFSF13 can contribute to aberrant epithelial- B cell crosstalk in the human colon.","Objective: Cytokines produced by epithelial and immune cells can act upon one another to promote mucosal healing- a process that goes awry with chronic inflammation as in inflammatory bowel disease.

Pathogenic loss-of-function variants that result in SCN1A haploinsufficiency cause the most common DEE, known as Dravet syndrome (DS). Pathogenic gain-of-function variants have been found to cause a more severe, early-onset epilepsy syndrome that is distinct from DS. Here, we investigated DNA methylation patterns in these individuals with SCN1A variants.","Deficits in chemosensory processing are associated with healthy aging, as well as numerous neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). In many cases, chemosensory deficits are harbingers of neurodegenerative disease, and understanding the mechanistic basis for these changes may provide insight into the fundamental dysfunction associated with aging and neurodegeneration. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a powerful model for studying chemosensation, aging, and aging-related pathologies, yet the effects of aging and neurodegeneration on chemosensation remain largely unexplored in this model, particularly with respect to taste. To determine whether the effects of aging on taste are conserved in flies, we compared the response of flies to different appetitive tastants. Aging impaired response to sugars, but not medium-chain fatty acids that are sensed by a shared population of neurons, revealing modality-specific deficits in taste. Selective expression of the human amyloid beta (Ab) 1-42 peptide bearing the Arctic mutation (E693E) associated with early onset AD in the neurons that sense sugars and fatty acids phenocopies the effects of aging, suggesting that the age-related decline in response is localized to gustatory neurons. Functional imaging of gustatory axon terminals revealed reduced response to sugar, but not fatty acids. Axonal innervation of the fly taste center was largely intact in aged flies, suggesting that reduced sucrose response does not derive from neurodegeneration. Conversely, expression of the amyloid peptide in sweet-sensing taste neurons resulted in reduced innervation of the primary fly taste center. A comparison of transcript expression within the sugar-sensing taste neurons revealed age-related changes in 66 genes, including a reduction in odorant-binding protein class genes that are also expressed in taste sensilla. Together, these findings suggest that deficits in taste detection may result from signaling pathway-specific changes, while different mechanisms underly taste deficits in aged and AD model flies. Overall, this work provides a model to examine cellular deficits in neural function associated with aging and AD.","Integrin alpha–V (ITGAV) forms heterodimers with beta subunits to regulate several cellular processes including transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling. We examined three unrelated families with common disease features including two children born with congenital brain anomalies and later development of immune dysregulation, atopy, and colitis, and three fetuses with brain and developmental defects. Using whole exome and RNA sequencing and functional studies, we demonstrate that biallelic ITGAV variants caused abnormal splicing or mislocalized protein that led to dysregulated TGF-β signaling in these families. Furthermore, knockout itgav (-/-) zebrafish embryos developed brain defects with loss of microglia and juvenile itgav (-/-) zebrafish developed colitis. Together, we show the critical role of ITGAV in immune regulation and gut and brain homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.","Preeclampsia (PE) affects 5-8% of pregnancies and has detrimental effects on maternal-fetal health. PE is characterized by de novo hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation and end-organ damage. Systemic inflammatory imbalance has been associated with PE, but its contribution to the pathology is poorly understood. Our objective was to investigate maternal systemic immune changes in early-onset PE (EOPE) and late-onset PE (LOPE) vs uncomplicated pregnancies (CTRL), and their contribution to endothelial activation, hallmark of hypertension. Blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, multiplex assay, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), and single-cell RNA sequencing. We performed co-cultures between circulating immune cells and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs) to assess endothelial activation. We found that EOPE had decreased Treg (4.64±0.33, p&lt;0.05) and monocytes (33.92±3.08, p&lt;0.01), whereas LOPE had decreased Treg (4.60±0.30, p&lt;0.05) and Th2 cells (7.50±0.62, p&lt;0.01) vs CTRL. Compared to CTRL, elevated cytokines/chemokines, and growth factors were observed in LOPE, whereas EOPE primarily showed decreased levels. Using ICS, we observed more monocytes producing IL-12, TNF, and IL-1 (all p&lt;0.05) in LOPE vs CTRL. At the transcriptomic level, we found differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between EOPE and CTRL, predominantly related to upregulation of immune activation pathways. Lastly, EOPE peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) induced heightened endothelial activation in vitro observed by increased ICAM-1 and ET-1 (p&lt;0.05), whereas LOPE PBMCs required LPS stimulation. While significant proteomic changes are observed in the LOPE group, the EOPE displayed changes mostly at the transcriptomic levels and could induce endothelial activation in vitro.","To study cell type- and HTT CAG length-dependent transcriptional and alternative splicing changes associated with HD, we conducted deep RNA-sequencing analysis on human embryonic stem cells (hESC), NPC and neuron cell lines (ESC and NPC, NEU) expressing wild-type (27/ and 30 CAG repeats), 45 CAG (45Q; representing 45 polyQ mutant HTT protein) and 81 CAG (81Q) repeat expansion HTT gene (n=3). The cell lines were derived from an isogenic HTT CAG repeat expansion allelic cell line panel (IsoHD) where hESC H9 cells were genetically modified with monoallelic knockin of expanded CAG tract in exon 1 of HTT representing early onset (45Q) and late onset (81Q) HD, with the 27Q/30Q genotype as healthy control phenotype (Ooi et al., 2019). The sequencing experiment generated 2.9 billion pairs of 150 bp paired-end reads from 27 samples (3 clones, 3 genotypes, 3 cell lines), with 80 to 110 million read pairs per sample. Transcriptome alignment yielded 75 to 100 million uniquely mapped read pairs across all samples.","Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the aggregation of α-synuclein into Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the brain. Microglia-driven neuroinflammation may contribute to neuronal death in PD, however the exact role of microglia remains unclear and has been understudied. The A53T mutation in the gene coding for α-synuclein has been linked to early-onset PD, and exposure to A53T-mutant human α-synuclein increases the potential for inflammation of murine microglia. To date, its effect has not been studied in human microglia. We aimed to study the impact of the A53T mutation on human microglia developed in a physiologically relevant context Here, we used 2-dimensional cultures of human iPSC-derived microglia and transplantation of these cells into the mouse brain to assess the effects of the A53T mutation on human microglia. We found that A53T-mutant human microglia had an intrinsically increased propensity towards pro-inflammatory activation upon inflammatory stimulus. Additionally, A53T mutant microglia showed increased oxidative stress, with a strong decrease in catalase expression in non-inflammatory conditions. Together, these results indicate that A53T mutant human microglia display cell-autonomous phenotypes that may worsen neuronal damage in early-onset PD.","Dravet syndrome (DS) is a devastating early onset refractory epilepsy syndrome caused by variants in the SCN1A gene. A disturbed GABAergic interneuron function is implicated in the progression to DS but the underlying developmental and pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive, in particularly at the chromatin level. In this study, we utilized induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from DS cases and healthy donors to model disease-associated epigenetic abnormalities of GABAergic development. Employing the ATAC-Seq technique, we assessed chromatin accessibility at multiple time points (Day 0, Day 19, Day 35, and Day 65) of GABAergic differentiation. Additionally, we elucidated the effects of the commonly used anti-seizure drug valproic acid (VPA) on chromatin accessibility in GABAergic cells. The distinct dynamics in chromatin profile of DS iPSC predicted accelerated early GABAergic development, evident at D19, and diverged further from the pattern in control iPSC with continued differentiation, indicating a disrupted GABAergic maturation. Exposure to VPA at D65 reshaped the chromatin landscape at a variable extent in different iPSC-lines and rescued the observed dysfunctional development in some DS iPSC-GABA. This study provides the first comprehensive investigation on the chromatin landscape of GABAergic differentiation in DS-patient iPSC, offering valuable insights into the epigenetic dysregulations associated with interneuronal dysfunction in DS. Moreover, our detailed analysis of the chromatin changes induced by VPA in iPSC-GABA holds the potential to improve development of personalized and targeted anti-epileptic therapies.","Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a serious genetic bone disorder characterized by congenital low bone mass, deformity and frequent fractures. Type XV OI is a moderate to severe form of skeletal dysplasia caused by WNT1 mutations. In this cohort study from southern China, we summarized the clinical phenotypes of patients with WNT1 mutations and found the proportion of type XV patients was around 10.3% (25 out of 243) with diverse phenotypic spectrums. Functional assays indicated that mutations of WNT1 significantly impaired its secretion and effective activity, leading to moderate to severe clinical manifestations, porous bone structure and enhanced osteoclastic activities. Analysis of proteomic data from human skeleton indicated that the expression of SOST was dramatically reduced in type XV patients. Single-cell transcriptome data generated from human tibia samples revealed aberrant differentiation trajectory of skeletal progenitors and impaired maturation of osteocytes, resulting in excessive CXCL12+ progenitors and abnormal cell populations with adipogenic characteristics. The integration of multi-omics data from human skeleton delineates how WNT1 regulates the differentiation and maturation of skeletal progenitors, which will provide a new direction for the treatment strategy of type XV osteogenesis imperfecta and relative low bone mass diseases such as early onset osteoporosis.","Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a serious genetic bone disorder characterized by congenital low bone mass, deformity and frequent fractures.

Healthy control (WTC11, Coriell repository) iPSCs were used as reference. iPSCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes for transcriptome analysis and assessment of the c.442G&gt;A variant on MYBPC3 splicing.","Mitochondrial dysfunction causes devastating disorders, including mitochondrial myopathy. Here, we identified that diverse mitochondrial myopathy models elicit a protective mitochondrial integrated stress response (mt-ISR), mediated by OMA1-DELE1 signaling. The response was similar following disruptions in mtDNA maintenance, from knockout of Tfam, and mitochondrial protein unfolding, from disease-causing mutations in CHCHD10 (G58R and S59L). The preponderance of the response was directed at upregulating pathways for aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, the intermediates for protein synthesis, and was similar in heart and skeletal muscle but more limited in brown adipose challenged with cold stress. Strikingly, models with early DELE1 mt-ISR activation failed to grow and survive to adulthood in the absence of Dele1, accounting for some but not all of OMA1’s protection. Notably, the DELE1 mt-ISR did not slow net protein synthesis in stressed striated muscle, but instead prevented loss of translation-associated proteostasis in muscle fibers. Together our findings identify that the DELE1 mt-ISR mediates a stereotyped response to diverse forms of mitochondrial stress and is particularly critical for maintaining growth and survival in early-onset mitochondrial myopathy. This experiment used the Clariom_S_Mouse Microarray from Affymetrix/Applied Biosystems to analyze the effect of Dele1 KO and OMA1 KO under cold stress.","Mitochondrial dysfunction causes devastating disorders, including mitochondrial myopathy.

The dementia familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) is caused by polymerisation of the neuronal serpin neuroserpin (NS) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of neurons. We have generated transgenic neural progenitor cell (NPC) cultures from mouse embryonic cerebral cortex, stably expressing the control protein GFP (green fluorescent protein), or human wild type, G392E or deltaNS. We have characterised these cells in the proliferative state and after differentiation to neurons. Our results show that G392E NS formed polymers that were mostly retained within the ER, while wild type NS was correctly secreted as a monomeric protein into the culture medium. DeltaNS was absent at steady state due to its rapid degradation, but it was easily detected upon proteasomal block. Looking at their intracellular distribution, wild type NS was found in partial co-localisation with ER and Golgi markers, while G392E NS was localised within the ER only. Furthermore, polymers of NS were detected by ELISA and immunofluorescence in neurons expressing the mutant but not the wild type protein. We used our model system to investigate which cellular pathways were activated by intracellular polymers of G392E NS by performing RNA sequencing of differentiated cells expressing G392E NS or the negative control protein GFP, and identified 747 genes with a significant upregulation (623) or downregulation (124) in G392E NS-expressing cells. We focused our attention on genes involved in the defence against oxidative stress that were up-regulated in cells expressing G392E NS.

However, the predictive factors that determine sensitivity to ICIs have not been fully elucidated. To identify the mechanisms underlying ICI resistance, we performed a microarray analysis to compare the IFN-γ-inducible genes between ICI-sensitive AB1-HA and ICI-resistant LLC in vitro.","In syngeneic solid tumor models, C5aR1 inhibition significantly enhanced the effectiveness of poly I:C, a toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist, combined with Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade. In this experiment we aim to determine the effects of C5aR1 inhibition in the genes expression of Lewis Lung Cancer (LLC) tumors treated with poly I:C and PD-1 blockade combined treatment.","Pcif1 KO mice can significantly inhibit tumor growth. We attempted to explore the changes in tumor immune microenvironment of tumor-bearing mice after Pcif1 KO by single-cell sequencing.","Although the association between inflammation and cancer development has been recognized, how inflammation affects the outcomes of immunotherapy and chemotherapy hasn’t yet been well evaluated. In this study, we found that CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing member 4 (CMTM4) was highly expressed in multiple human and murine cancers. Loss of CMTM4 significantly reduced tumor growth and impaired NFB, mTOR, PI3K/Akt pathway activation. Interestingly, we found that CMTM4 can regulate epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling post-translationally by promoting EGFR recycling and preventing its degradation through Rab proteins. Consequentially, CMTM4 knockout promoted response sensitivity of human tumor cells to EGFR inhibitors. Importantly, CMTM4 knockout tumors stimulated with EGF significantly decreased their production of inflammatory cytokines including G-CSF, leading to decreased recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells and thus, a less suppressive tumor-immune-environment. Therapeutically, siRNA-liposome targeting CMTM4 reduced tumor growth in vivo and prolonged animal survival. Furthermore, CMTM4 knockout enhance immune checkpoint blockade or chemotherapy to reduce tumor growth. These data suggest that CMTM4 represents a novel target to inhibit tumor inflammation and improve immune response and drug sensitivity.","The functions of the DNA repair protein Ku70 in immune homeostasis and tumor immunity remain unexplored. Here, we conducted deep sequencing of mRNA profiles from tumor-infiltrating Treg cells (from Foxp3Cre and Xrcc6fl/fl;Foxp3Cre mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells). By comparing gene expression profiles, we found that Ku70-absent Treg displayed activated pathways in response to inflammatory factors and upregulated expression of genes negatively regulated by Foxp3. These findings strongly indicate that Ku70 plays a supportive role in enhancing Foxp3 transcriptional activity.","Natural Killer (NK) cells play a pivotal role against cancer, both by direct killing of malignant cells and by promoting adaptive immune response though cytokine and chemokine secretion. In the lung tumor microenvironment (TME), NK cells are scarce and dysfunctional, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. By conducting single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung tumors, and exploring pseudotime, we uncovered that the TME disrupts the maturation trajectory of NK cells in a tumor stage-dependent manner, ultimately resulting in the selective exclusion of the cytotoxic subset. Using functional assays, we observed intratumoral NK cell death and a reduction in cytotoxic capacities depending the tumor stage. Finally, our analyses of human public dataset on lung cancer corroborate these findings, revealing a parallel dysfunctional maturation process of NK cells during tumor progression. These results highlight novel mechanisms by which tumor cells escape from NK cell cytotoxicity, therefore paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies.","The tumor microenvironment holds significant importance in cancer development and progression. Research conducted using mouse models of tumor cell transplantation can enhance our comprehension of the tissue microenvironment that allows tumor growth at an early stage. Among these models, those featuring the Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cell line are noteworthy due to their low immunogenic features. Since numerous cancer patients do not respond effectively to current immunotherapy, it is imperative to investigate models with low immunogenic features. Consequently, this study employed single-cell RNA sequencing on an orthotopic lung cancer mouse model utilizing the LLC cell line to profile the characteristics of diverse cell types that emerge in the lung during tumor engraftment. The lung microenvironment exhibited discernible transformations, including fibrogenic gene expression, increased cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion, and reduced infiltration of T cells compared to lungs without tumor engraftment. In conclusion, these findings reveal cellular and molecular alterations that can be targeted for tumor prevention and treatment for low-immunogenic tumors.","The Open Problems Perurbation Prediction (OP3) dataset is to-date the largest single-cell small molecule perturbation dataset in primary tissue with multiple donor replicates. Compounds are dosed in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), enabling the robust computation of perturbation effects on gene expression across four distinct cell type populations: T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and Myeloid cells. This dataset is the basis for the OP3 benchmark, which evaluates machine learning models on the task of extrapolation perturbation effects into unseen cell types.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Cancer cells metastatic to the leptomeninges encounter a metabolically-challenging extreme microenvironment. To understand adaptations to this space, we subjected leptomeningeal-metastatic (LeptoM) mouse breast and lung cancers isolated from either the leptomeninges or orthotopic primary sites to ATAC- and RNA-sequencing. When inhabiting the leptomeninges, the LeptoM cells demonstrated transcription downstream of retinoid-X-receptors (RXRs). We found evidence of local retinoic acid (RA) generation in both human leptomeningeal metastasis and mouse models in the form of elevated spinal fluid retinol and expression of RA-generating dehydrogenases within the leptomeningeal microenvironment. Stimulating LeptoM cells with 9-cis RA induced expression of transcripts encoding de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway enzymes in vitro. In vivo, whereas knockout of Stra6 did not alter cancer cell leptomeningeal growth, knockout of Rxra/b/g interrupted cancer cell lipid biosynthesis and arrested cancer growth. These observations illustrate a mechanism whereby locally-generated developmental cues metabolically reprogram metastatic cancer cells and suggest novel therapeutic approaches.","To understand transcriptional regulation of nuclear receptors, LXRs and RXRs, in leptomeningeal metastatic cancer cells, we use CRISPR-Cas9 to knockout Nr1h2/3 genes (encoding LXRβ/α) or RXRa/b/g genes (encoding RXRα/β/γ) in LLC LeptoM cell lines, with small guide RNA targeting lacZ as vector control. We then subjected these cell lines for bulk RNA sequencing with or without stimulation of 1μM 9 cis-RA. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes between LLC LeptoM vector control with RA stimulation to DMSO treatment revealed upregulation of developmental related pathways and lipid metabolism pathways. Meanwhile, loss of function in LXR or RXR both resulted in dysregulation of multiple lipid metabolism pathways, in which RXR made a broader impact.","Cancer cells metastatic to the leptomeninges encounter a metabolically-challenging extreme microenvironment.

Here we find the disruption of methionine metabolism by rapid SAMe depletion in skeletal muscle in cancer cachexia, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the overexpression of regulated in development and DNA damage responses (REDD1). Targeting the DNA methylation process via DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and REDD1 knockout can alleviate cancer cachexia-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. Methionine supplementation maintains the DNA methylation of DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (Ddit4) by DNMT3A, thereby inhibiting activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-mediated Ddit4 transcription. Our study suggests that methionine or SAMe supplementation can effectively reverse muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia, providing valuable mechanistic insights and a promising therapeutic strategy for clinical application.","The epidemiological association of coxsackievirus B infection with type 1 diabetes suggests that therapeutic strategies that reduce viral load could delay or prevent disease onset.  Moreover, recent studies suggest that treatment with antiviral agents against coxsackievirus B may help preserve insulin levels in type 1 diabetic patients. In the current study, we performed small RNA-sequencing to show that infection of immortalized trophoblast cells with coxsackievirus caused differential regulation of several miRNAs. One of these, hsa-miR-AMC1, was similarly upregulated in human pancreatic β cells infected with coxsackievirus B4.  Moreover, treatment of β cells with non-cytotoxic concentrations of an antagomir that targets hsa-miR-AMC1 led to decreased CVB4 infection, suggesting a positive feedback loop wherein this microRNA further promotes viral infection. Interestingly, some predicted target genes of hsa-miR-AMC1 are shared with hsa-miR-184, a microRNA that is known to suppress genes that regulate insulin production in pancreatic β cells.  Consistently, treatment of coxsackievirus B4-infected β cells with the hsa-miR-AMC1 antagomir was associated with a trend toward increased insulin production. Taken together, our findings implicate novel hsa-miR-AMC1 as a potential early biomarker of coxsackievirus B4-induced type 1 diabetes and suggest that inhibiting hsa-miR-AMC1 may provide therapeutic benefit to type 1 diabetes patients. Our findings also support the use of trophoblast cells as a model for identifying microRNAs that might be useful diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for coxsackievirus B-induced type 1 diabetes.","We establish a mouse model of HCoV-NL63 and compare outcomes with a model of rhinovirus (RV)-A1B.  Transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 were infected intranasally with sham LLC-MK2 cell lysate,  100,000 TCID50 units HCoV-NL63, or 1,000,000 PFU RV-A1B.  Lungs were assessed for host gene expression by next generation sequencing.  RNAseq showed increases in IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-λ and many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in NL63-infected mice.  In addition to ISGs, RV-A1B induced expression of IFN-γ, IL-1β, NLRP3, TLR2 and C-X-C chemokines. We established a mouse model of HCoV-NL63 replicative infection characterized by expression of ISGs but fewer pro-inflammatory genes compared to RV-A1B.","Pediatric brain cancer is the leading cause of disease-related mortality in children, and many aggressive tumors still lack effective treatment strategies. Despite extensive studies characterizing these tumor genomes, alternative transcriptional splicing patterns remain underexplored. Here, we systematically characterized aberrant alternative splicing across pediatric brain tumors, identifying pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs) among the most heterogeneous. Through integration with UniProt Knowledgebase annotations, we identified 12,145 splice events in 5,424 genes, leading to functional changes in protein activation, folding, and localization. We discovered that the master splicing factor and cell-cycle modulator, CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1), is aberrantly spliced in HGGs to include exon 4, resulting in a gain of two phosphorylation sites and subsequent activation of CLK1. Inhibition of CLK1 with Cirtuvivint in the pediatric HGG KNS-42 cell line significantly decreased both cell viability and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Morpholino-mediated depletion of CLK1 exon 4 splicing reduced RNA expression, protein abundance, and cell viability. Notably, KNS-42 cells treated with the CLK1 exon 4 morpholino demonstrated differential expression impacting 173 cancer genes and differential splicing with loss or gain of a functional site in 529 cancer genes. These genes were enriched for cancer-associated pathways, with 20 identified as significant gene dependencies in pediatric HGGs. Our findings highlight a dependency of pediatric HGGs on CLK1 and its roles contributing to tumor splicing heterogeneity through transcriptional dysregulation of splicing factors and direct transcriptional modulation of oncogenes. Overall, aberrant splicing in HGGs and other pediatric brain tumors represents a potentially targetable oncogenic pathway contributing to tumor growth and maintenance. Continued investigation of these mechanisms is essential for developing new effective treatment strategies for these patients.","Background: As emerging component of the tumor microenvironment, intratumoural microbiota imperceptibly influences the progression of various human malignancies. However, the critical intratumoural microbiota and its role in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression has not been fully elucidated. Results: Herein, we reveal significant abnormalities in the intratumoural microbiota of NSCLC by analyzing the microbiota profiles of tumor and non-malignant tissues from NSCLC patients. Specifically, Gram-negative bacteria were significantly increased in intratumoural bacteria, and network analysis revealed that Escherichia-Shigella and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae, which had strong ability to synthesize bacterial toxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS), could significantly promote tumor proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that Escherichia-Shigella and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae-derived LPS activated the TLR4-mTOR-NF-κB-IL-6 axis to facilitate the proliferation of NSCLC, while rapamycin could effectively postpone LPS-induced tumor proliferation through in vitro cell culture and in vivo murine model. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the combined diagnosis of intratumoural bacterial concentration, Escherichia-Shigella, and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae had higher diagnostic validity than the individual diagnosis in predicting the probability of NSCLC, and their detection in blood has the potential to be combined with imaging for non-invasive diagnosis of NSCLC. Conclusions: Collectively, this research discovered increased Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia-Shigella, and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae in NSCLC tumors, and clarified the mechanism of these bacteria-derived LPS in promoting tumor development, providing new strategies for the treatment and diagnosis of NSCLC from a microbial perspective.","Immunotherapy has revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatment. However, both primary and acquired resistance to immunotherapy, emerged during the co-evolution of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), commonly restrain long-term tumor control. In exploring the oncogenic activity of Ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), we unexpectedly discovered that this epigenetic regulator exhibits altered expression and aberrant cytosolic localization in cancerous tissues. Cytoplasmic translocation of UHRF1 is induced by its phosphorylation on a specific serine in response to signals provided by factors present in the TME, such as TGF-, enabling UHRF1 to bind MHC-I and promote its ubiquitination and degradation via the E3 activity of UHRF1. Down-regulation of MHC-I results in suppression of the antigen presentation pathway to establish a non-T cell-inflamed TME favoring tumor growth. Genetic deletion of UHRF1 synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment and induces an anti-tumor memory response by evoking low-affinity T cells upon sustained UHRF1 inactivation. Our study unveils a novel function of UHRF1 in cancer immune evasion and provides a potential target to synergize with immunotherapy and overcome immunotherapeutic resistance.","Purpose:gene discrepancy analysis and signaling pathway of tumor tissues in the PBS, Taraxasterol, DC tumor vaccine and Taraxasterol combined with DC tumor vaccine group","The role of eosinophils in the development and progression of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) remains unclear. However, MPE is a frequently occurring manifestation of advanced cancer and is often associated with a poor prognosis. While current treatment options for MPE can provide palliative care, alternative therapies are urgently needed. To investigate this role, eosinophil counts were determined using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Eosinophil-deficient mice (Eos-null) and Cd3δ -promoter Il5 transgenic (Il5 Tg) mice were subjected to a mouse model of MPE. Eosinophils were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and their transcriptional profile was obtained by RNA sequencing. Finally, we evaluated the effects of the C-C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) and a C-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) axis on MPE pathology using recombinant mouse CCL11 and a CCR3 inhibitor. In humans, eosinophil counts were increased in MPE and negatively correlated with the LENT score. In animal models, eosinophils were rapidly recruited to the pleural cavity when challenged with tumor cells. Interestingly, eosinophil deficiency worsened MPE, while an increase in eosinophils through various methods improved MPE. Furthermore, the recruitment of eosinophils may be influenced by the CCL11-CCR3 axis. Taken together, the study highlights the protective role of eosinophils against MPE formation, indicating their potential as a therapeutic strategy. Moreover, the CCL11-CCR3 axis may be a viable target for MPE treatment.","5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an enzyme that plays a key role in providing methyl groups for DNA methylation, including during spermatogenesis. A common genetic variant in humans (MTHFR 677C&gt;T), results in reduced enzyme activity and has been linked to various disorders, including male infertility. A new animal model has been created by reproducing the human equivalent of the polymorphism in mice using CRISPR/Cas9. Biochemical parameters in the Mthfr 677TT mice recapitulate alterations found in MTHFR 677TT men. Our aims were to: 1) characterize the sperm DNA methylome of the Mthfr 677CC and TT mice on a control diet (2mg folic acid/kg diet) and 2) assess the effects of folic acid deficiency (0.3mg/kg diet) and supplementation (10 mg/kg diet) on the sperm DNA methylome. Body and reproductive organ weights, testicular sperm counts, and histology were examined. DNA methylation in sperm was assessed using bisulfite pyrosequencing, Illumina Mouse Methylation Array and whole genome bisulfite sequencing. Reproductive parameters and imprinted gene methylation were unaffected by genotype or diets. The largest effect was due to genotype, with sperm from 677TT mice showing more hypo- than hypermethylation. Folate-deficient diets resulted in sperm hyper- and hypomethylation in CC and TT mice. Folic acid supplementation caused mostly hypermethylation in sperm of males of both genotypes and was found to partially correct the DNA methylation alterations in sperm associated with the TT genotype. The new mouse model will be useful in understanding the role of MTHFR deficiency in male fertility and in designing folate supplementation regimens for the clinic.","5, 10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a crucial enzyme in the folate metabolic pathway with a key role in generating methyl groups. As MTHFR deficiency impacts male fertility and sperm DNA methylation, there is the potential for epimutations to be passed to the next generation. Here, we assessed whether the impact of MTHFR deficiency on testis morphology and sperm DNA methylation is exacerbated across generations. While MTHFR deficiency in F1 fathers has only minor effects on sperm counts and testis weights and histology, F2 generation sons show further deterioration in reproductive parameters. Extensive loss of DNA methylation is observed in both F1 and F2 sperm, with &gt;80% of sites shared between generations, suggestive of regions consistently susceptible to MTHFR deficiency. These regions are generally methylated during late prenatal germ cell development and are enriched in young retrotransposons. As retrotransposons are resistant to reprogramming of DNA methylation in prenatal germ cells, their hypomethylated state in the sperm of F1 males could contribute to the worsening reproductive phenotype observed in F2 MTHFR- deficient males, findings compatible with the intergenerational passage of epimutations.","Supplementation with high doses of folic acid, an important mediator of one-carbon transfers for DNA methylation, is used clinically to improve sperm parameters in infertile men. We recently detected an unexpected loss of DNA methylation in the sperm of idiopathic infertile men after 6 months of daily supplementation with 5mg folic acid (&gt;10× the daily recommended intake-DRI), exacerbated in men homozygous for a common variant in the gene encoding an important enzyme in folate metabolism, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C&gt;T). To investigate the epigenomic impact and mechanism underlying effects of folic acid on male germ cells, wildtype and heterozygote mice for a targeted inactivation of the Mthfr gene were fed high-dose folic acid (10× the DRI) or control diets for six months. No changes were detected in general health, sperm counts or methylation of imprinted genes.  Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing revealed sperm DNA hypomethylation in Mthfr+/- mice on the 10× diets. Wildtype mice demonstrated sperm hypomethylation only with a very high dose (20×) of folic acid for 12 months. Testicular MTHFR protein levels decreased significantly in wildtype mice on the 20× diet but not in those on the 10× diet, suggesting a possible role for MTHFR deficiency in sperm DNA hypomethylation. In-depth analysis of the folic acid-exposed sperm DNA methylome suggested mouse/human susceptibility of sequences with potential importance to germ cell and embryo development. Our data provide evidence for a similar cross-species response to high dose folic acid supplementation, of sperm DNA hypomethylation, and implicate MTHFR downregulation as a possible mechanism.","Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that low folate diet (control diet with 2mg folate/kg, low folate diet with 0.3mg folate/kg) can induce intestinal tumors in BALB/c mice. We used microarrays to compare  MTHFR+/+ BALB/c mice fed control diet and MTHFR+/- BALB/c mice fed low folate diet.","Analysis of intestine from MTHFR+/- BALB/c mice fed a low folate diet (0.3mg/kg) for 1 yr.

In addition, we reported that C57Bl/6J mice did not form tumors under the same conditions. We used microarrays to identify the genetic differences between BALB/c and C57Bl/6J mice that promote tumorigenesis in BALB/c mice.

Children that experience CMD characteristically present with various degrees of cognitive and motor symptoms and signs, much like cerebral palsy.  MeHg has thus been characterized as a neurotoxicant, where motor deficits are ascribed to central nervous system targets. Skeletal muscle as a post-synaptic MeHg target and contributor to the etiology of CMD has garnered far less attention.  Prior studies using Drosophila to model CMD revealed that developmental exposure of MeHg in the larval/pupal stages can elicit graded and latent dose responses affecting adult flight behavior at lower doses (0.4-2.5 ppm in food) and eclosion (emergence from the pupa case) at higher doses (&gt;2.5 ppm in food).  The latter phenotype is accompanied by dysmorphogenesis of skeletal muscles. Here, we investigate respective roles for muscle and neural targets in MeHg toxicity. Using RNA-seq analysis, we find that developmental MeHg exposure produces 10-times as many differentially expressed transcripts in indirect flight muscle (IFM) compared to the VNC. Among known MeHg response genes, Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway genes showed muscle-specific MeHg-induced expression changes. Within the muscle transcriptome, the most enriched and significant Gene Ontology terms identified genes required for mitochondrial ribosomal translation at the pupa stage and mitochondrial function (respiratory chain complex I) and vesicle trafficking (ESCRT III) pathways in adults, all showing decreased expression with MeHg exposure. By using an intact, whole-animal developmental model, we identify preferential candidates to evaluate a novel role for muscle-specific mitochondria and intercellular vesicular communication mechanisms as targets in MeHg toxicity and the etiology of CMD.","Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is initiated by perinatal asphyxia, leading to brain injury triggered by reduced blood and oxygen flow, resulting in neurological impairments such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, cognitive deficits, and behavioral disorders.Recent insights collectively suggest the important roles of lysyl oxidase (LOX) in the pathological processes of several acute and chronic neurological diseases, but the molecular regulatory mechanisms in HIBD remain elusive.In this study, we found through the study of HIBD rat models and the  oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) cell models that LOX significantly increased after HIBD or OGD/R. RNA seq results showed a significant increase in piezo1 after primary neuron OGD/R, and iron death data was also enriched. Moreover, inhibiting LOX or piezo1 can rescue neuronal ferroptosis and further improve cognitive function in rats. In addition, we also found that traumatic acid can inhibit the enzyme activity of LOX and improve a series of pathological features of neuronal damage caused by increased LOX.","We previously reported that loss-of-function of TYW1 led to cerebral palsy with severe intellectual disability through reduced neural proliferation. However, whether TYW1 loss affect neural differentiation is unknown. In this study, we first demonstrated that TYW1 loss blocked the formation of OHyW in tRNAphe, therefore affected the translation efficiency of UUU codon. Using the brain organoid model, we showed impaired neuron differentiation when TYW1 was depleted. Interestingly, retrotransposons were differentially regulated in TYW1-/- hESCs. In particular, one kind of human-specific endogenous retrovirus-K (HERVK/HML2), whose reactivation impaired human neurodevelopment, was significantly up-regulated in TYW1-/- hESCs. Consistently, a UUU codon enriched protein, SMARCAD1, which was a key factor in controlling endogenous retroviruses was reduced. Taken together, TYW1 loss leads to upregulation of HERVK in hESCs by down-regulated SMARCAD1, thus impairing neuron differentiation.","Background: Chromosomal 16p11.2 deletions and duplications are genomic disorders which are characterized by neurobehavioral abnormalities, obesity, congenital abnormalities and so on. However, the prenatal phenotypes of 16p11.2 copy number variations (CNVs) are still not well described till now. This study aimed to provide an elaborate summary of intrauterine phenotypic features for such genomic disorders.     Methods: Twenty prenatal amniotic fluid samples diagnosed with 16p11.2 microdeletions/microduplications were obtained from pregnant women who opted for invasive prenatal testing. Karyotypic analysis and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) were performed in parallel. The pregnancy outcomes and health conditions after birth for all cases were followed up. Meanwhile, we made a pooled analysis on the prenatal phenotypes for the published cases carrying 16p11.2 CNVs.     Results: 20 fetuses (20/20884, 0.10%) with 16p11.2 CNVs were identified: five 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion, ten 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion and five 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 duplication. Abnormal ultrasound findings were recorded in ten participants with 16p11.2 deletions.Various degrees of intrauterine phenotypic features, ranging from normal to abnormal, were observed. No ultrasound abnormalities were observed for all 16p11.2 duplication cases during the pregnancy period. For 16p11.2 deletions, eleven cases terminated their pregnancies. For 16p11.2 duplications, four cases gave birth to healthy neonates except one was lost to follow up.    Conclusions: Diverse prenatal phenotypes were presented in 16p11.2 CNVs, ranging from normal to abnormal. For 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion, the most common structural and non-structural abnormalities were the abnormality of the vertebral column or rib and thickened nuchal translucency, respectively. 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion might be closely associated with fetal growth restriction and single umbilical artery. No representative ultrasound findings for 16p11.2 duplication were observed till now. Considering the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance of 16p11.2 CNVs, long term follow up after birth should be carried out for these cases. We identified 20 fetuses carrying the 16p11.2 microdeletions and microduplications using chromosomal microarray analysis. And diverse prenatal phenotypes and the critical genes involved in the deleted/duplicated regions were described in this study.","Objective: Chromosomal 1q21.1 deletions and duplications are genomic disorders which are usually diagnosed postnatally. However, the genotype-phenotype correlations of 1q21.1 copy number variants (CNVs) during prenatal period are still not clear. This study aimed to provide a systematical summary of prenatal phenotypes for such genomic disorders.  Methods: Twenty-six prenatal amniotic fluid samples diagnosed with 1q21.1 microdeletions/microduplications were obtained from pregnant women who opted for invasive prenatal testing. Karyotypic analysis and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) were performed for all cases simultaneously. The pregnancy outcomes and health conditions after birth for all cases were followed up. Meanwhile, prenatal cases with 1q21.1 microdeletions or microduplications in the literature were retrospectively collected.  Results: Eleven pregnancies (11/8252, 0.13%) with 1q21.1 microdeletions and fifteen (15/8252, 0.18%) with 1q21.1 microduplications were identified. Among these 1q21.1 CNVs, four cases covered thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) region, sixteen cases covered 1q21.1 recurrent microdeletion/microduplication region, and six cases covered all regions mentioned above. The prenatal abnormal ultrasound findings were recorded in four participants with 1q21.1 deletions and seven participants with 1q21.1 duplications. Finally, three cases with 1q21.1 deletions and five with 1q21.1 duplications terminated their pregnancies.  Conclusion: 1q21.1 microdeletions were associated with increased nuchal translucency (NT), anomalies of urinary system and cardiovascular abnormalities, and 1q21.1 microduplications were correlated with cardiovascular malformations, nasal bone dysplasia and increased NT in prenatal setting. In addition, cerebral ventriculomegaly might be correlated with 1q21.1 microduplications. Considering the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance of 1q21.1 CNVs, long term follow up after birth should be carried out for these cases. We identified 26 fetuses carrying the 1q21.1 microdeletions and microduplications using chromosomal microarray analysis. And diverse prenatal phenotypes and the critical genes involved in the deleted/duplicated regions were described in this study.","Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disease and a major cause of systemic inflammation leading to neurocognitive, behavioral, metabolic, and cardiovascular dysfunction in children and adults. However, the impact of OSA on the heterogeneity of circulating immune cells remains to be determined. scRNA-seq demonstrated OSA-induced heterogeneity in cellular composition and enabled the identification of previously undescribed cell types in PBMCs.","Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) remains a major neurological complication of prematurity that results in cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, and cognitive deficits. No effective therapy exists to prevent these disorders in infants with IVH. IVH triggers inflammation, cellular infiltration and white matter injury following neurobehavioural deficits.","Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) remains a major neurological complication of prematurity that results in cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, and cognitive deficits.

We performed small RNA-seq and focused on the microRNA cargo of EVs. The role of miR-486 was further explored using cell culture experiments.","In this study, the properties of circulating EVs were examined in cerebral palsy (CP) and typically developed (TD) individuals at rest and after aerobic exercise.

Current diagnosis of CP mainly relies on neuroimaging and motor assessment, and we aimed to explore novel biomarkers for CP diagnosis in the present study. Blood plasma from five CP children and their healthy twin brothers/sisters was analyzed by gene microarray to screen out differential expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs).","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Limb contractures are a debilitating and progressive consequence of a wide range of pediatric conditions that affect skeletal muscles, including perinatal brain injury causing cerebral palsy (CP). While several rehabilitation therapies are currently used in the clinical setting, their long-term effectiveness in treating contractures is marginal since they do not change underlying muscle biological properties. Therefore, new therapies based on a biological understanding of contracture development are needed. Here we show that myoblast progenitor cells from contractured muscle in children with CP had higher rates of proliferation than control cells from typically developing children. This phenotype was associated with upregulation of DNMT3a and patterns of DNA hypermethylation and gene expression that favored cell expansion over quiescence. Treatment of CP progenitors with 5-azacytidine, a DNMT inhibitor and hypomethylating agent, normalized this epigenetic imprint and promoted exit from mitosis. Together with previous studies demonstrating reduction in myoblast differentiation capacity, these data suggest that mechanisms of early myofiber growth and establishment of an adult population of quiescent stem cells could be compromised in CP. Hypomethylating agents like 5-azacytidine could be used to rescue myogenesis and promote muscle growth in contractured muscle and thus may represent a new approach to treating this devastating condition","Limb contractures are a debilitating and progressive consequence of a wide range of pediatric conditions that affect skeletal muscles, including perinatal brain injury causing cerebral palsy (CP).

It causes irreversible damage to the overall function of the central nervous system resulting in cerebral palsy, convulsions, epilepsy, cognitive, motor dysfunction and other late effects. CircRNAs are participate in the biological processes underlying many nervous system diseases. However, the circRNA expression profile of peripheral venous blood of premature infants with PWMD is not completely understood. Three premature with white matter damage (PWMD group) and three infants without brain injury (Normal group) were enrolled. Peripheral venous blood was collected from both groups for extraction of RNA and circRNA sequencing was performed. The RNA-seq technique was used to screen the differentially expressed circRNA in peripheral blood of infants with PWMD. The accuracy of sequencing results was verified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) to the differentially express partial circRNA in the sequencing results. Bioinformatics analysis of Host genes was performed with differential circRNA. TargetScan and Miranda were used to predict circRNA-binding miRNAs and mapped into a circRNA-miRNA co-expression network. There were 119 significantly different circRNAs as compared with premature without brain injury, along with 1 circRNA was up-regulated and 4 circRNAs were down-regulated expression in the PWMD group. Combined with the existing research results and bioinformatics analysis results after sequencing, it is suggested that circRNA may regulate the occurrence and development of white matter damage in premature infants by interacting with miRNA. This first study of its kind further identified the expression profile of circRNA in peripheral blood of premature with WMD, and provide a novel targets for further investigation about the molecular mechanisms underlying PWMD and potential therapeutic intervention.","Our results revealed that hypoxic-ischemic brain injury decreased the overall 5hmC abundance in rat temporal cortex, and these results suggest that 5hmC modifications are involved in the cerebral palsy pathogenesis.","Deficiency of arginase is associated with hyperargininemia, and unlike the other disorders of the urea cycle, the major mechanism of metabolism of nitrogen in terrestrial mammals, are characteristic and prominent features that include spastic diplegia/tetraplegia, clonus, and hyperreflexia; loss of ambulation, intellectual disability and progressive neurological decline are other signs. To gain greater insight into the unique neuromotor features, we performed gene expression profiling of the motor cortex of a well-characterized murine model of the disorder. Co-expression network analysis suggested an abnormality with myelination, which was supported by limited existing human data. Utilizing electron microscopy, marked dysmyelination was detected in 2-week-old homozygous ARG1 knockout mice. The corticospinal tract was found to be adversely affected, supporting dysmyelination as the cause of the unique neuromuscular features and implicating oligodendrocyte impairment in a deficiency of hepatic ARG1. Following neonatal hepatic gene therapy to express ARG1, the subcortical white matter, pyramidal tract, and corticospinal tract all showed a remarkable recovery in terms of myelinated axon density and ultrastructural integrity with active wrapping of axons by nearby oligodendrocyte processes. These findings support the following conclusions: first, arginase deficiency is a leukodystrophy affecting the brain and spinal cord while sparing the peripheral nervous system; and second, neonatal AAV hepatic gene therapy can rescue the defects associated with myelinated axons, strongly implicating the functional recovery of oligodendrocytes after restoration of hepatic arginase activity. These findings support the consideration of early restoration of hepatic arginase activity in those afflicted with arginase deficiency.","Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as childbirth occurring at less than 37 completed weeks or 259 days of gestation. Premature babies have higher rates of cerebral palsy, sensory deficits, learning disabilities and respiratory illnesses that extend into adulthood. This lifelong morbidity results in high economic and social costs to families and communities. PTB is a syndrome initiated by multiple mechanisms, including infection or inflammation, uteroplacental ischaemia or haemorrhage, uterine overdistension, stress, and other immunologically mediated processes. Identifying and monitoring molecular signals in easily accessible body fluids that can diagnose or predict the risk of preterm labor in pregnant women will reduce or prevent PTBs. A number of studies reported the identification of putative biomarkers for PTB including protein, miRNA and hormone from different body fluids such as serum/plasma, cervical vaginal fluid, saliva and amniotic fluids. These putative biomarkers identified can largely be grouped into three main functional categories: inflammatory related molecules, placenta or fetal derived molecules and stress related molecules. In the past few years next generation sequencing (NGS) has become the major platform for miRNA analysis especially with body fluids. However, studies have shown significant sequence bias among different small RNA library preparation protocols. We have modified the small RNA library construction protocol which greatly reduces the sequence bias and increase miRNA coverage in sample. We also adapted a newly developed size exclusion chromatography (SEC) based EV purification protocol which can provide cleaner EVs compared to other methods. We are using these improved approaches to gain more reliable profile of circulating RNA in body fluid as well as its associated EVs. With these new approaches, we explore the possibility of using specific circulating miRNAs, specifically those encapsulated in EVs, as a noninvasive biomarker for PTB by comparing the miRNA profiles in maternal plasma, EV and EV-depleted plasma between individuals who had a spontaneous preterm birth and uncomplicated pregnancies.","Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant that is often detected in the tissues of fish-eating species. It has been well established that prenatal exposure to MeHg can lead to widespread brain damage and impaired neurological development resulting in defects ranging from severe cerebral palsy and cognitive deficits to impaired motor and sensory function. A wide range of environmental toxicants have been shown to induce transgenerational inheritance of diseases via changes in DNA methylation—a well-known epigenetic modification. Our previous research has demonstrated that developmental MeHg exposure may yield transgenerational inheritance of neurological dysfunction in adult F3-lineage zebrafish via quantitative neurobehavioral assays that evaluated the visual startle response, retinal electrophysiology, and locomotor function. The objective of the current study was to examine the correlation between neurobehavioral phenotypes and the transcriptome activity in the brain and retina of F3 zebrafish by RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Transcriptomic analyses of F3 generation MeHg-treated zebrafish (compared to control) revealed significant gene dysregulation in both the brain and retina. There were 1648 and 138 differentially expressed genes in the retina and brain, respectively (FDR &lt;0.05). Thirty-five genes were commonly dysregulated in both organs. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significantly enriched pathways including: neurodevelopment, visual functions, phototransduction, and motor movement. Moreover, commonly dysregulated genes were associated with circadian rhythm and metabolic pathways, as well as arginine and proline metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a transgenerational transcriptome induced by ancestral developmental exposure to MeHg in any species.  If the transgenerational phenotypes, transcriptome, homologous biomarkers, or similar molecular pathways hold true for human populations, our findings have significant impact on global public health in terms of identifying the susceptible populations using biomarkers and preventing  transgenerational inheritance of MeHg-induced neurobehavioral deficits.","This study investigates how master splicing regulators interact and the extent to which transcription regulators are spliced differently during brain development. Cell-type-specific RNA-Seq analyses of the developing neocortex uncover variable expression of the Rbfox1/2/3 genes and enriched splicing events in transcription regulators, altering protein isoforms or inducing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Transient expression of Rbfox proteins in radial glial progenitors induces neuronal splicing events preferentially in transcription regulators such as Meis2 and Tead1. Surprisingly, Rbfox proteins promote the inclusion of a mammal-specific alternative exon and a previously undescribed poison exon in Ptbp1. Simultaneous ablation of Rbfox1/2/3 in the neocortex downregulates neuronal isoforms and disrupts radial neuronal migration. Furthermore, the progenitor isoform of Meis2 promotes Tgfb3 transcription, while the Meis2 neuron isoform promotes neuronal differentiation. These observations indicate that transcription regulators are differentially spliced between cell types in the developing neocortex.","The intestinal mucosal barrier is a dynamic system that allows nutrient uptake, stimulates healthy microbe-host interactions, and prevents invasion by pathogens. The mucosa consists of epithelial cells connected by cellular junctions that regulate the passage of nutrients covered by a mucus layer that plays an important role in host-microbiome interactions. Mimicking the intestinal mucosa for in vitro assays, in particular the generation of a viscous mucus layer, has proven to be challenging. Here, we present a novel in vitro intestinal culture model that produces a robust mucus layer and is based on the widely used intestinal Caco-2 cell line. We investigated the effects of air-liquid interface (ALI) culturing compared to liquid-liquid interface (LLI) on Caco-2 cells grown under low-glucose conditions in Transwell plates. In addition, we determined the impact of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) on mucus secretion, epithelial barrier properties and microbe-mucus interactions. A combination of ALI culturing with VIP addition led to formation of a robust mucus layer on the apical surface of the Caco-2 confluent layer in which the intestinal secreted mucin MUC2 was a major component. RNAseq analysis demonstrated upregulation of unique gene clusters in response to ALI and VIP conditions, but the ALI-VIP combination treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of multiple mucin genes and proteins including MUC2, MUC13 and MUC17. Expression of tight junction proteins was significantly altered in the ALI-VIP condition leading to increased permeability to small molecules, more closely reflecting an intestinal epithelium permissive for nutrient uptake. In infection experiments with commensal Lactobacillus plantarum, pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the ALI-VIP mucus layer separated the bacteria from the underlying epithelium. In conclusion, ALI-VIP culture of Caco-2 cells provides an attractive in vitro model to study the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier and pathogenic and commensal microbe-host interactions.","Nogo-A is a major regulator of neural development and regeneration in the central nervous system, but its role in tooth innervation remains largely unknown. Neurons of the trigeminal ganglion innervate the teeth. We showed that Nogo-A is expressed in the trigeminal ganglion and tooth-related nerve fibres. Nogo-A deletion in mice leads to a less complex neuronal network when compared to wild-type animals. Bulk RNA sequencing on the trigeminal ganglia of Nogo-A KO and wild-type mice revealed gene expression changes associated with alterations in neurotrophin signalling and neuronal synaptic formation during the development and maturation of the trigeminal neurons.","Hypoxia tolerance is mainly controlled by the hypoxia signaling pathway and HIF-1α/2α serve as master regulators in this pathway. Here we identify MYLIP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase thought to specifically target lipoprotein receptors, as a negative regulator of HIF-1α/2α. MYLIP interacts with HIF-1α/2α and catalyzes K27-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 118/442 (HIF-1α) or lysine 117 (HIF-2α). This modification induces proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α, resulting in inhibition of hypoxia signaling. Furthermore, Mylip-deficient bluntsnout bream, zebrafish and mice are more tolerant to hypoxia. These findings reveal a role for MYLIP in regulating hypoxia signaling and identify a target for developing fish strains with high hypoxia tolerance for the benefit of the","Stress susceptibility varies across individuals, influenced by genetic, molecular, and environmental factors. Considering the individual differences in response to stress, however, approaches for exercise treatment as an antidepressant and anxiolytic intervention are also not exempt from variability in effectiveness among individuals, and insight into the biology of those variations can be gained by examining the individual adaptation to exercise. Here, we investigated the efficacy of voluntary wheel running (VWR) exercise as a disease-modifying intervention for stress-susceptible (SS) mice subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRST). Multidimensional behavior analysis revealed significant variability in the efficacy of VWR among individuals, with some mice showing substantial behavior phenotypic improvements (e.g., behavior despair, anhedonia, aversion to open space, and compulsive behavior) (SES) while others displayed limited or no benefits (SER). Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), a critical brain region involved in emotional regulation and processing, demonstrated that SES mice exhibited molecular signatures promoting adaptive changes by restoring cellular repair, energy availability, and synaptic plasticity observed in SS mice, whereas SER mice exhibited limited behavior resilience and distinct transcriptomic profiles enriched in structural adaptation without functional resilience and glia cell differentiation, particularly marked by astrocyte activation or differentiation. These findings suggest that while VWR can alleviate multiple concurrent behavior symptoms in stress-susceptible mice; however, its efficacy is influenced by distinct biological processes. Collectively, our work highlights the importance of a multivariate framework for behavior assessment and genetic underpinnings to better understand the often-overlooked variability in response to stress and the therapeutic efficacy of exercise in stress-related disorders.","Understanding mammalian preimplantation development, particularly in humans, at the proteomic level remains limited. Here, we applied our Comprehensive Solution of Ultrasensitive Proteome Technology to measure the proteomic profiles of oocytes and early embryos, and identified nearly 8,000 proteins in humans and over 6,300 proteins in mice. We observed distinct proteomic dynamics before and around zygotic genome activation (ZGA) between the two species. Integrative analysis with translatome data revealed extensive divergence between translation activation and protein accumulation. Multi-omic analysis indicated that ZGA transcripts contribute to protein accumulation in blastocysts. Consequently, we identified several transcriptional regulators critical for early development in mice, thereby linking ZGA to the first lineage specification. Furthermore, single-embryo proteomics of poor quality embryos from over 100 patient-couples provided insights into preimplantation development failure. Our study may contribute to reshaping the framework of mammalian preimplantation development and opening new avenues for addressing human infertility.","B cell somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection in germinal center (GC)s enhance antibody affinity to antigen. Conventional understanding holds that SHM enhances pre-existing antibody specificities, limiting the scope of SHM-based antibody evolution to those established in the primary repertoire through V(D)J recombination. By tracking pre-defined non-specific B cells, we observed consistent SHM in non-cognate antibody genes after immunization in settings of diverse, polyclonal B and T cells. Removing B cell competition enabled these non-specific yet somatically mutating antibodies to develop entirely new specificities to diverse antigens. Our findings introduce an updated model, where SHM drives antibody diversification without requiring initial antigen specificity. This reveals that B cell competition, rather than a necessity for specific affinity, limits the emergence of new affinities (termed here as affinity birth) by SHM and highlights the mammalian adaptive immune system’s capacity to explore antibody-antigen interactions beyond the epitopes targeted by the V(D)J-dependent primary antibody repertoire.","Previous studies from our lab have characterized a group of splicing factors called SR proteins that function to identify intron/exon borders in regulating metabolic homeostasis in the Drosophila fat body.  Decreasing the function of one SR protein, 9G8, causes an increase in triglyceride storage; however, the function of 9G8 in other metabolic tissues like the fly intestine is not known.  Decreasing 9G8 in the Drosophila intestine results in the accumulation of triglycerides; however, the 9G8 target genes responsible for this phenotype are unknown.  To address this question, we performed RNA sequencing on Drosophila intestines with 9G8 levels reduced by RNAi.","We used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the differences in the transcriptional landscapes between stiff and compliant MMTV-PyMT mouse mammary tumors. We found similar compositions of cancer and stromal subpopulations in compliant and stiff tumors but differential intercellular communication and a significantly higher concentration of tumor-promoting, M2-like macrophages in the stiffer tumor microenvironments.","To monitor ORF10s effects on the host transcriptome, doxycycline-inducible cell lines were create in A549 and 293T(HEK) cells expressing ORF10. Because doxycycline itself can alter gene expression, we used doxycycline-inducible cell lines driving GFP as control. Empty vectors were used as well.","The activation of fibroblasts and production of extracellular matrix (ECM) after cardiac injury has been the focus of research on cardiac fibrosis. Whether imprinted genes play a role in the fibrogenesis or extracellular matrix production after heart damage has not been studied. Here, we show that the imprinted gene Pw1 directed ECM production by regulating de novo purine synthesis (DNPB) after myocardial infarction (MI). After MI, the DNA methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) of Pw1 gene in the injured area was reduced and both alleles of Pw1 in fibroblasts are activated. Further, loss of Pw1 in fibroblasts can enhance cardiac function, reduce cardiac fibrosis and extracellular matrix secretion after cardiac injury. To screen the targets of PW1, we contrasted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and RNA-seq using the injured left ventricles at 7 days post-MI, we next found PW1 binds directly upstream of the Pfas gene that encodes one of the DNPB enzymes phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS) in heart after injury. Similarly, specific knockout of pfas in fibroblasts also improves cardiac function and reduces ECM production. Moreover, de novo purine biosynthesis is necessary for ECM production in activated fibroblasts. These observations implicate understanding the mechanism of Pw1 in the repair of cardiac injury will provide new ideas for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a pivotal component of the tumor microenvironment, significantly contributing to the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Direct co-culture of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one of the origins of CAFs, with ESCC cell line, led to increased amphiregulin (AREG) expression and secretion in the ESCC cells. Consequently, the expression and phosphorylation of the AREG receptor EGFR were upregulated in co-cultured ESCC cells. Moreover, AREG treatment enhanced ESCC cell survival and migration through the EGFR-Erk/p38 signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis of AREG using human ESCC tissues showed a positive correlation between the intensity of AREG expression in tumor invasive front and the expression level of the CAF marker FAP. Furthermore, bioinformatics database analysis confirmed a significant upregulation of AREG expression in ESCC tissues compared to normal tissues. These findings suggest that AREG is involved in CAF-mediated ESCC progression and could be a novel therapeutic target for ESCC.","Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction caused by obesity can be associated with alterations in the levels of microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the role of miRNAs in such processes remains elusive. Here, we show that pancreatic islet miR-27a-5p, which is markedly increased in obese mice and impairs insulin secretion, is mainly delivered by visceral adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Depleting miR-27a-5p significantly improves insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in db/db mice. Supporting the function of EVs’ miR-27a-5p as a key pathogenic factor, intravenous injection of miR-27a-5p-containing EVs shows their distribution in mouse pancreatic islets. Tracing the injected AAV-miR-27a-5p (AAV-miR-27a) or AAV-FABP4-miR-27a-5p (AAV-FABP4-miR-27a) in visceral fat results in upregulating miR-27a-5p in EVs and serum, and elicits mouse pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, miR-27a-5p directly targets L-type Ca2+ channel subtype CaV1.2 (Cacna1c) and reduces insulin secretion in β-cells. Overexpressing mouse CaV1.2 largely abolishes the insulin secretion injury induced by miR-27a-5p. These findings reveal a causative role of EVs’ miR-27a-5p in visceral adipocyte-mediated pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Cancer cells disseminated to distant sites enter a period of dormancy before generating overt metastases. The ability of these cells to elude immune surveillance determines their persistence as latent disease. We report that TGF-β promotes dormancy in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mouse models by placing disseminated SOX2+ and NKX2-1+ progenitors in a quiescent state that biomechanically averts killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. In these primitive progenitors, TGF-β induces an atypical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β drives expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin that changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the stiffness of metastatic progenitors and their killing by mechanosensitive CTLs and NK cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors activate a biomechanical process to evade immune-mediated elimination during prolonged dormancy periods. Inhibiting this process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells.","Chronic arsenic exposure can lead to various health issues including cancer. There has been a growing concern about co-exposure to various prevalent lifestyle habits and their role in the enhancement of arsenic toxicity. Smokeless tobacco (SLT) products are extensively consumed in many South Asian countries, where their use frequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To decipher the oral epithelial cell responses to arsenic and SLT alone and in co-exposure, we performed multi-omics analyses of DNA methylome, transcriptomic reprogramming and genotoxic effects in controlled experimental settings. Chronic exposure studies revealed hypomethylation of genes involved in inflammation response and apoptosis, further corroborated by the upregulation of genes involved in these processes due to arsenic and the combined treatment in acute exposure setting. Next, to validate the omics results at the phenotypic level, we observed a dose dependent decrease in cell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes, and an increase in apoptotic cells, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT co-exposure conditions. The observed DNA damage was likely the result of apoptosis induction, as chronic exposure experiments based on whole-exome sequencing did not reveal increased mutagenicity following the arsenic and/or SLT exposure. Our integrative omics study provides insights into both chronic and acute responses to arsenic and SLT co-exposure, with both types of responses converging on some of the same mechanisms. We identified large-scale epigenomic and transcriptomic reprograming associated with arsenic and SLT co-exposure, alongside genotoxic effects presumably manifesting as consequences of apoptosis induction. The findings point to a role of arsenic and SLT in altering key molecular responses, especially in the context of the co-exposure, and call for further studies in humans in the areas of exposure, to validate the observed mechanisms.","Chronic arsenic exposure can lead to various health issues including cancer.

Cell states are defined by their epigenetic landscape and have cell state-specific metabolic demands. Defining the regulatory factors involved in the interplay between metabolism and cell state would represent a significant step forward in understanding the genetic circuitry that drives differentiation of progenitor cells into highly specialized cell types for proper tissue formation. Expression levels of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) mega-cluster have been shown to correlate with distinct metabolic profiles in a variety of progenitor cells, suggesting it functions as a key regulator of metabolism and cell state. Here, we directly demonstrate that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a central player coordinating mitochondrial metabolic activity and genome-wide epigenetic changes in myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Stable muscle cell lines were generated harboring two distinct deletions in the proximal promoter region resulting in either greatly upregulated or severely attenuated transcription of the entire mega-cluster of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. Both mutant lines displayed impaired myotube formation along with perturbed mitochondrial respiration and widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and histone methylation. Global gene expression patterns and pathway analyses indicated a reprogramming of cell state which created a differentiated-like molecular profile in proliferating myoblasts. Our results strongly suggest that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a nodal regulator coordinating metabolic activity and the epigenome to maintain proper cell state in the myogenic lineage.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal breast cancer subgroup, as lack of targeted therapies and drug resistance reduce survival rates. Cellular plasticity enables cells to adapt non-genetically and overcome therapeutic pressure, thereby embodying a critical clinical hurdle. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an example of phenotypic reprogramming linked to plasticity, drug resistance and metastasis. However, its exact impact on population diversity under therapeutic pressure is unknown. Here, we used single cell transcriptomics to investigate phenotypic diversity dynamics upon drug treatment in two human in vitro models of TNBC plasticity.","Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal breast cancer subgroup, as lack of targeted therapies and drug resistance reduce survival rates.

Haploinsufficiency of Dyrk1a in mice reportedly leads to ASD-related phenotypes. However, the key pathological mechanisms remain unclear and human DYRK1A mutations remain uncharacterized in mice. Here, we generated and studied Dyrk1a-knockin mice carrying a human ASD patient mutation (Ile48LysfsX2; Dyrk1a-I48K mice). These mice display severe microcephaly, social and cognitive deficits, dendritic shrinkage, excitatory synaptic deficits, and altered phospho-proteomic patterns enriched for multiple signaling pathways and synaptic proteins.","Transcription factor 21 (TCF21) is a basic helix-loop-helix protein required for developmental specification of cardiac fibroblasts from epicardial progenitor cells that normally surround and invade the heart. In the adult heart, TCF21 is expressed in tissue resident fibroblasts but is downregulated in response to injury or stimuli leading to myofibroblast differentiation. These findings led to the hypothesis that Tcf21 could be a regulator of fibroblast cell-fate in the adult mammalian heart and contribute to cardiac fibrosis. Here, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing was used to identify TCF21 genome occupancy in adult cardiac fibroblasts.","MEIS1 and MEIS2 encode highly conserved homeodomain transcription factors crucial for developmental processes in a wide range of tissues, including the brain. They can execute redundant functions when co-expressed in the same cell types, but their roles during early stages of neural differentiation have not been systematically compared. By separate knockout and overexpression of MEIS1 and MEIS2 in human neural stem cells, we find they control specific sets of target genes, associated with distinct biological processes. Integration of DNA binding sites with differential transcriptomics implicates MEIS1 to co-regulate gene expression by interaction with transcription factors of the SOX and FOX families. MEIS1 harbors the strongest risk factor for restless legs syndrome (RLS). Our data suggest that MEIS1 can directly regulate the RLS-associated genes NTNG1, MDGA1 and DACH1, constituting new approaches to study the elusive pathomechanism or RLS.","MEIS1 and MEIS2 encode highly conserved homeodomain transcription factors crucial for developmental processes in a wide range of tissues, including the brain.

Gene expression data were annotated at gene level with the Affymetrix library for Clariom D arrays (human).","Climate change is impacting human health through a historic rise in wildfire smoke across the United States and the world. Whereas the deleterious effects of wildfire smoke and associated air pollution on asthma outcomes are well-established epidemiologically, genetic risks and molecular mechanisms of how wildfire smoke affects asthma are unknown. This knowledge gap hinders the identification of high-risk individuals and the creation of targeted therapies or recommendations to protect these individuals. Here, we employ a genetic approach to identify common variant (minor allele frequency &gt; 0.05) exposure-conditional genetic risk variants that localize with genomic responses to wood smoke particles (WSP), a model of wildfire smoke exposure, and associate with asthma in the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort. Our novel approach used nascent transcriptional signatures derived from WSP-exposed Beas-2B airway epithelial cells to reduce the genome sequence for discovery and allow a permutation-based statistical approach to identify 52 candidate SNPs. We applied biologic and bioinformatic filters to prioritize variants for direct testing of allele-dependent transcriptional regulatory function in plasmid reporters. The rs3861144 variant identified by this approach controls WSP responses of airway epithelial cells to SPRY2, which we showed is involved in mechanical injury repair in cell culture. Our results demonstrate that wildfire particulates contribute to asthma risk at the molecular level, and we have identified mechanistic targets and genetic variant candidates to apply for clinical risk prediction and development of targeted therapies for high-risk individuals.","To probe for the impact of a age-related clonal hematopoiesis associated somatic mutation on monocyte-derived microglia and macrophages in the CNS, we took advantage of a mouse model that harbors a replacement of the murin Dnmt3a gene with a cDNA cassette encoding the human DNMT3A R882H variant. To seed the CNS with monocyte-derived cells from hDNMT3A mut hematopoietic stem cells, we engrafted Cx3cr1-gfp mice with bone marrow of 10-month-old Vav-Cre: hDNMT3A fl/fl mice. After 4 months following irradiation, endogenous microglia and leptomeningeal macrophages, and engrafted cells were isolated from both mutation and wild type groups for bulk RNAseq analysis.","Complement Factor H (CFH) common genetic variants have been associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). While most previous in vitro RPE studies focused on the common p.His402Tyr CFH variant, we characterized rare CFH variants that are highly penetrant for AMD using induced pluripotent stem cell derived retinal pigment epithelium (iPSC-RPE). Our results show that lower FH levels were detected in AMD RPE, which potentially disrupted canonical and non-canonical roles of FH. Specifically, AMD RPE displayed higher inflammation rate and a reduced set of differentially expressed genes compared to control RPE upon A2E and blue light challenge. Additionally, cholesterol efflux and POS phagocytosis defects, dysregulated complement levels, larger sub-RPE deposits and increased mitochondrial stress were observed in AMD RPE. Thus, our study reveals new non-canonical roles for FH in regulating important RPE functions.","Rhodopsin P23H mutation is the most comment mutation causing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa in the USA. The goal of this project is to compare the transcriptome changes of the Rhodopsin P23H knock-in mouse model of adRP to the wildtype control at different ages. The transcriptomic profile will help us understand the molecular events along the pathophysiology of reititis pigmentosa in this mouse model. We include the RNA seq data of Rhodopsin P23H heterozygous mouse retinas at 1, 3 and 6 months of age to compare with age-matched wildtype mouse retinas. N=3 and each sample is from an individual animal.","In search for broad-spectrum antivirals, we discovered a small molecule inhibitor, RMC-113, that potently suppresses the replication of multiple RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 in human lung organoids. We demonstrated selective dual inhibition of the lipid kinases PIP4K2C and PIKfyve by RMC-113 and target engagement by its clickable analog. Advanced lipidomics revealed alteration of SARS-CoV-2-induced phosphoinositide signature by RMC-113 and linked its antiviral effect with functional PIP4K2C and PIKfyve inhibition. We discovered PIP4K2C’s roles in SARS-CoV-2 entry, RNA replication, and assembly/egress, validating it as a druggable antiviral target. Integrating proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and functional assays revealed that PIP4K2C regulates virus-induced impairment of autophagic flux. Reversing this autophagic flux impairment via promoting degradation of viral protein is a mechanism of antiviral action of RMC-113. These findings reveal virus-induced autophagy regulation via PIP4K2C, an understudied kinase, and propose dual inhibition of PIP4K2C and PIKfyve as a candidate strategy to combat emerging viruses.","Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was conducted on 199 individuals (398 samples, pre- and post-treatment with Dex) recruited at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP). Whole blood samples were analyzed using the Illumina EPIC v1 DNA Methylation Beadchip to obtain comprehensive DNA methylation profiles.","The purpose of this experiment is to delineate whether Akt over-expression is sufficient to induce a marginal zone-like phenotype in B cells at the molecular level. Mice expressing constitutively Akt in B cells have almost only marginal zone B cells in secondary lymphoid organs, as much as we can say through characterization of cell surface receptor by flow cytometry. These analyses were conducted in order to gain a more precise understanding of the relationship between WT marginal zone B cells and marginal zone B cells produced as a result of constitutive Akt signalling.","The novel neomorphic Fgf9Y162C mouse mutant was recently reported to cause small lenses and later on cataracts. Since Fgf9 is expressed also in other tissues and organs, we performed a systematic and comprehensive phenotyping of the heterozygous and homozygous mutants in the German Mouse Clinic. We did not observe any effect on dysmorphological parameters, on bone &amp; cartilage, and no neurological effects (including pain). However, we observed an improved glucose tolerance in both sexes, but reduced lactate levels in homozygous males, and increased corticosterone levels in female mutants. Analysis of the blood count revealed more white blood cells, a higher frequency of T-cells in homozygous male mutants and an increased concentration of IgE in female mutants indicating that the immune system including the allergy state is affected at least in one sex. The Fgf9Y162C mutants showed also a significantly smaller total lung capacity, which might be due of non-significant changes in inspiratory capacity and functional residual capacity. Finally, we observed a decreased locomotion of the mutants combined with a decreased ability for social discrimination. These different phenotypes are interpreted as pleiotropic consequences of the mutation in those tissues where Fgf9 is expressed. In addition, transcriptome profiling of lenses from 18 week old homozygote mice revealed changes on molecular level associated with phototransduction and ophthalmic diseases.","Abcb5 is a member of the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. It is an energy dependent transporter and its role is unknown yet. We are characterizing this transporter at the genomic and protein level. We know that it is highly expressed in pigmented cells, including pigmented cells of the CNS (retinal pigment epithelium and basal ganglion cells). We found it highly expressed in melanotic melanoma and in alveolar soft part sarcoma.","MALT1 is an essential component of the T cell receptor (TCR)-induced T cell activation pathway. Two alternative splice isoforms of MALT1 (ISO A and ISO B) are conserved within vertebrae, which differ in the presence of exon 7 (MALT1 ISO A). We show by isoform-specific reconstitution of MALT1-deficient CD4-positive T cells that MALT1 ISO A mediates additional functions in T cell activation. Transcriptome-wide analysis revealed a distinct subset of genes specifically upregulated in presence of exon 7.","In order to find out whether insects are suitable as a pure protein source and what potential problems or benefits can be expected, a 10-week feeding experiment was set up. In this experiment, the overall protein content were identical, while the protein content from soy and fishmeal was replaced with 25, 50, 75 and 100% insect meal. In order to evaluate the effect of the insect protein on the fish, fish size and weight were determined at the beginning and end of the experiment, and transcriptomic analyses of proximal intestine were performed. Finally, samples of the liver and intestine were examined histologically.","Chromatin is dynamically reorganized when DNA replication forks are challenged. However, the process of epigenetic reorganization and its implication for fork stability is poorly understood. Here, we discover a checkpoint regulated cascade of chromatin signaling that activates the histone methyltransferase EHMT2/G9a to catalyze heterochromatin assembly at stressed replication forks. Using biochemical and single molecule chromatin fiber approaches, we show that G9a together with SUV39h1 induces chromatin condensation by accumulating the silent mark, H3K9me1/2/3, in the vicinity of stressed replication forks. This closed conformation is also favored by the G9a-dependent exclusion of the H3K9-demethylase JMJD1A/KDM3A, which facilitates heterochromatin disassembly upon fork restart. Untimely heterochromatin disassembly from stressed forks by KDM3A enables PRIMPOL access, triggering ssDNA gaps formation and sensitizing cells towards chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings may help explaining chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis observed in cancer patients displaying elevated level of G9a/H3K9me3.modifications (PTMs) in a single mass spectrum. Combined with immunoprecipitation, Nuc-MS quantified nucleosome co-occupancy of histone H3.3 with variant H2A.Z (sixfold over bulk) and the co-occurrence of oncogenic H3.3K27M with euchromatic marks (for example, a &gt;15-fold enrichment of dimethylated H3K79me2). Nuc-MS is highly concordant with chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and offers a new readout of nucleosome-level biology.","Prostate cancer often progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), with neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) representing a highly aggressive variant. This study shows that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in vascular endothelial cells, induced by IL-1β and TGF-β2, enhances neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer cells. LNCaP cells co-cultured with EndMTed HUVECs exhibited increased expression of neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A. GM-CSF emerged as a key mediator in this process, and its addition under androgen deprivation conditions further elevated neuroendocrine marker expression. Anti-androgen therapy with enzalutamide also paradoxically increased IL-1β and TGF-β2 secretion, promoting EndMT and subsequent neuroendocrine differentiation. These results highlight the potential of targeting EndMT and GM-CSF pathways as therapeutic strategies for aggressive, treatment-resistant forms of NEPC.","An abnormal expansion of a G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), two debilitating neurodegenerative disorders driven in part by gain-of-function mechanisms involving transcribed forms of the repeat expansion. By utilizing a Cas13 variant with reduced collateral effects, we developed a high-fidelity RNA-targeting CRISPR-based system for C9ORF72-linked ALS/FTD. When delivered to the brain of a transgenic rodent model, this Cas13-based platform curbed the expression of the G4C2 repeat-containing RNA without affecting normal C9ORF72 levels, which in turn decreased the formation of RNA foci, reduced the production of a dipeptide repeat protein, and reversed transcriptional deficits. This high-fidelity system possessed improved transcriptome-wide specificity compared to its native form and mediated targeting in motor neuron-like cells derived from a patient with ALS. These results lay the foundation for the implementation of RNA-targeting CRISPR technologies for C9ORF72-linked ALS/FTD.","An abnormal expansion of a G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), two debilitating neurodegenerative disorders driven in part by gain-of-function mechanisms involving transcribed forms of the repeat expansion.

The pathophysiology of lung I/R injury involves ferroptosis and elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, while the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on lung I/R injury remains unclear. This research aimed to explore the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on reducing ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells caused by I/R.  First, we identified O-GlcNAc transferase 1 (Ogt1) as a differentially expressed gene in lung epithelial cells of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) patients, using single-cell sequencing, and Gene Ontology analysis (GO analysis) revealed the enrichment of the ferroptosis process. We found a time-dependent dynamic alteration in lung O-GlcNAcylation during I/R injury. Proteomics analysis identified the differentially expressed proteins enriched in ferroptosis and multiple redox-related pathways based on KEGG annotation. Thus, we generated Ogt1-conditional knockout mice and found that Ogt1 deficiency aggravated ferroptosis, as evidenced by lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), Fe2+, as well as alterations in critical protein expression glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Consistently, we found that elevated O-GlcNAcylation inhibited ferroptosis sensitivity in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury-induced TC-1 cells via O-GlcNAcylated NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, both the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that Nrf2 could bind with translation start site (TSS) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and promote its transcriptional activity. As an important rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), elevated G6PDH provided a mass of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to improve the redox state of glutathione (GSH) and eventually led to ferroptosis resistance. Rescue experiments proved that Nrf2 knockdown or Nrf2-T334A (O-GlcNAcylation site) mutation abolished the protective effect of ferroptosis resistance.  In summary, we revealed that O-GlcNAcylation could protect against I/R lung injury by reducing ferroptosis sensitivity via the Nrf2/G6PDH pathway. Our work will provide a new basis for clinical therapeutic strategies for pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute lung injury.","Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome patients are uniquely susceptible to all renal tumour subtypes. The underlying mechanism of carcinogenesis is unclear. To study cancer development in BHD, we used human proximal kidney (HK2) cells with short-term and long-term folliculin (FLCN) knockdown. HK2 cells lacking FLCN had an altered transcriptome profile with cell cycle control gene enrichment. G1/S cell cycle checkpoint signaling was compromised with heightened protein levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Taken together with our proteomic work, our findings indicate that long-term FLCN  loss and associated cell cycle defects in BHD patients could contribute to their increased risk of cancer.","Metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the inflammatory stage of MASLD, will soon be one of the primary causes of liver-related complications, including advanced fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its steady increase in both the US and the global population is devastating. Between the two genders, more women are suffering from MASH compared to the man due to estrogen deficiency caused by polycystic ovary syndrome or menopause. Our published data shows a clear positive association between the progression of liver disease and the expression of novel hexokinase HKDC1 in the liver. Targeting HKDC1, which is highly expressed in pathological hepatocytes (in MASH) but negligible in normal hepatocytes, represents a highly selective approach. Therefore, we hypothesized that liver-specific deletion of HKDC1 will protect against diet-induced obesity and the progression of MASH to fibrosis. We used an early-onset liver knockout (LKO) of HKDC1 by crossing HKDC1 floxed mice with Albumin Cre mice to test our hypothesis. We fed the Western Diet to HKDC1LKO female mice along with HKDC1 floxed mice (HKDC1fl/fl; as Controls) for 28 weeks. Our data shows that HKDC1 deletion significantly decreases body weight and fat mass compared to HKDC1fl/fl mice with no changes in food intake and energy expenditure. Knockout mice have better glucose tolerance and lower fasting glucose levels than HKDC1fl/fl mice. Our data also shows that the knockout group has smaller livers, healthier liver parameters, less steatosis, and lower NAS and fibrosis scores. Furthermore, HKDC1 knockout alters hepatic gene expression, and we found significantly low proinflammatory and profibrogenic gene expression in the LKO mice. Although we did not see any changes in triglyceride levels, there was a significant reduction of serum cholesterol concomitant with enhanced expression of cholesterol metabolism genes in the knockout group. Our data suggest a promising protective role of HKDC1 deletion against diet-induced obesity and MASH mice.","Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) is disease-specific but has been poorly characterized in telomere biology disorders (TBD).We studied the architecture, trajectories, and impact of CH in a cohort of 207 TBD patients and assessed the clinical relevance of molecular signatures linked to telomere dysfunction. Most patients (92%) had known germline mutations in TBD genes. CH was rare in asymptomatic but present in 46% of symptomatic patients, recurrently in PPM1D, POT1, TERT promoter (TERTp), and U2AF1. CH frequency increased with age and was significantly higher than in age- matched controls. CH in PPM1D/TERTp was enriched in TERT patients while CH in POT1 was enriched in TINF2 patients. CH in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)-related genes, most commonly splicing factors, was enriched in TERT/TERC patients. CH in TERTp, TP53 ̧ and MDS- related genes associated with poorer survival. Chromosome 1q (Chr1q) gain, and splicing factor gene (dominated by U2AF1S34/Q157R) or TP53 mutations increased the risk of MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development, regardless of allele burden. Trajectories with successive acquisition of MDS-related CH driven by U2AF1S34/Q157R were maladaptive, while adaptive CH involved branched POT1/PPM1D/TERTp trajectories. U2AF1S34/Q157R compensated aberrant TP53 and interferon-γ pathway activation that contribute to hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion in TBD.","Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) is an increasingly used treatment for hematologic malignancies. Although post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PtCy) has improved graft vs. host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis in haplo-HCT, patients continue to experience life-threatening complications. IFN-γ and IL-6 are central in the pathophysiology of GvHD and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and both cytokines signal through Janus kinase (JAK)-1. We tested the effect of adding the JAK-1 selective inhibitor, itacitinib, to PtCy-haplo-HCT to mitigate these complications and improve overall survival. This open-label, single-arm study evaluated the safety and efficacy of itacitinib combined with standard GvHD prophylaxis after haplo-HCT. A total of 42 patients were treated with itacitinib 200 mg daily from day -3 through +100 or +180, followed by a taper. Itacitinib resulted in low CRS grades, all patients had grade 0 (22%) or grade 1 (78%) CRS and there were no cases of grade 2-5 CRS. There were no cases of primary graft failure. No patients developed grade 3-4 aGvHD through day +180. The cumulative incidence of grade 2 aGvHD at day +100 was 21.9%. The 1-year cumulative incidence of moderate or severe chronic GvHD was 5%. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 14%. Overall survival (OS) at 1 year was 80%. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality at day 180 was 8%. Itacitinib, when added to standard GvHD prophylaxis, was well tolerated and resulted in low rates of CRS, acute and chronic GvHD, NRM and encouraging rates of GvHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) and OS after haplo-HCT.","The interchromatin space in the cell nucleus contains various membrane-less nuclear bodies. Recent findings indicate that nuclear speckles, comprising a distinct nuclear body, exhibit interactions with certain chromatin regions in a ground state. Key questions are how this ground state of chromatin-nuclear speckle association is established and what are the gene regulatory roles of this layer of nuclear organization.  We report here that chromatin structural factors CTCF and cohesin are required for full ground state association between DNA and nuclear speckles. Disruption of ground state DNA-speckle contacts via either CTCF depletion or cohesin depletion had minor effects on basal level expression of speckle-associated genes, however we show strong negative effects on stimulus-dependent induction of speckle-associated genes. We identified a putative speckle targeting motif (STM) within cohesin subunit RAD21 and demonstrated that the STM is required for chromatin-nuclear speckle association.  In contrast to reduction of CTCF or RAD21, depletion of the cohesin releasing factor WAPL stabilized cohesin on chromatin and DNA-speckle contacts, resulting in enhanced inducibility of speckle-associated genes. In addition, we observed disruption of chromatin-nuclear speckle association in patient derived cells with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a congenital neurodevelopmental diagnosis involving defective cohesin pathways, thus revealing nuclear speckles as an avenue for therapeutic inquiry. In summary, our findings reveal a mechanism to establish the ground organizational state of chromatin-speckle association, to promote gene inducibility, and with relevance to human disease.","The interchromatin space in the cell nucleus contains various membrane-less nuclear bodies.

Two subtypes of ISCs exist, and both a- and b-ISCs regulate pH- and ion-homeostasis in epithelia. Gain and loss of Foxi1 function are associated with human diseases, including Pendred syndrome, male infertility, kidney malfunction and cancers. Foxi1 functions were predominantly studied in the context of ISC specification, however, reports indicate additional functions in early and ectodermal development. Here, we re-investigated the functions of Foxi1 to Xenopus laevis embryonic mucociliary epidermis development and found a novel function for Foxi1 in the generation of Notch-ligand expressing mucociliary multipotent progenitors (MPPs). We demonstrate that Foxi1 has multiple concentration-dependent functions: At low levels, Foxi1 confers ectodermal competence through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, while at high levels, Foxi1 induces a multi-step process of ISC specification and differentiation. We further describe how foxi1 expression is affected through auto- and Notch-regulation, how Ubp1 and Dmrt2 regulate ISC subtype differentiation, and how this developmental program affects Notch signaling as well as mucociliary patterning. Together, we reveal novel functions for Foxi1 in Xenopus mucociliary epidermis formation, relevant to our understanding of vertebrate development and human disease.","To reveal mRNAs expression differences in cumulus cells between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-PCOS women. mRNAs expression profile of the cumulus cell samples with PCOS and non-PCOS were determined by  Illumina Novaseq 6000.","The overall goal of this study was to characterize bone marrow cells based on their transcriptome, surface protein expression and BCR- and TCR VDJ-profile across disease diagnosis for accurate identification of clinically relevant cell states. This project has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 824110 (EASI-Genomics).","Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread reproductive disorder with hyperandrogenemia and impaired follicular development. Granulosa cells (GC) and thecal cells (TC) are crucial during follicular development, but their responses to androgen remain poorly understood at subpopulation levels. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed GC and TC subpopulations in Dehydroepiandrosterone-induced PCOS-like mice to determine the ovarian microenvironment characters. We observed gene expression changes in steroidogenesis and cell-cell communications, with significant landscape shifts in subtypes. GC subsets showed an inflammatory GC5 expansion and loss of luteinized GC7, while TC subsets exhibited an increased TC2 population with enhanced lipid metabolism and androgen response. Intercellular signaling was heightened, particularly with amplified ligand-receptor interactions for Ptn-Ncl and Mdk-Ncl. Steroidogenesis was altered for PCOS's steroid hormone abnormalities. These findings revealed androgen impact in the cell subpopulations of follicular microenvironment and underscored the importance of Ptn-Ncl and Mdk-Ncl in PCOS-associated impaired follicular development.","Physical exercise has been shown to induce epigenetic modifications with various health implications, and directly affect DNA methylation. The objectives of the present work were: 1) to identify differently methylated genes (DMGs) in saliva of school-aged children following a 3-month integrated neuromuscular training (INT); and 2) to explore if any of these genes are considered core-genes, i.e., genes of essential importance within the human genome. An additional goal was to locate the methylation changes in those genes in relation to the transcription start site (TSS) and the CpG site. Forty children (17 boys and 23 girls) were recruited from schools in Girona, Spain and allocated into control (N=20) or INT (N=20) group. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed with the Illumina 900K microarray. Core-genes were identified based on their participation in the enriched pathways, high connectivity (≥10) and as target-genes of key-transcription factors, using the bioinformatics software Metascape and Cytoscape, and the ENCODE dataset. There were 1200 DMGs in the control group and 414 DMGs in the INT group (p&lt;0.05). After screening among the DMGs, no core-genes were identified in the control group, but 17 core-genes were identified in the INT group. Remarkably, the 3-month-INT epigenetically modified 17 genes that are of essential importance within the human genome, related to inflammation, fat metabolism, protein metabolism, ATP binding and growth, as well as to metabolic, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, cancer and various syndromes (e.g., Noonan syndrome, Perry syndrome). Moreover, 88% of the methylation changes were close to the TSS, and 59% were in CpG islands. A 3-month-INT induced substantial epigenetic modifications with potential implications for disease prevention and health promotion in school-aged children.","The bone marrow microenvironment is key player in the regulation and maintenance of hematopoiesis and is also involved in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. We investigated the effect of KrasG12D expression in the non-hematopoietic bone marrow microenvironment. Therefore, we generated chimeric mice which express oncogenic Kras only in the non-hematopoietic system. Within 6-8 weeks, these mice developed a myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by cytopenia, myeloid expansion and signs of disturbed differentiation and marked dysplasia within the myeloid lineage. Gene expression analysis of KrasG12D expressing non-hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow microenvironment revealed a significant upregulation of multiple genes and pathways including proinflammatory signaling such as upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and related genes.","Cancer immunotherapy is gaining increasing attention. However, immune checkpoints are exploited by cancer cells to evade anti-tumor immunotherapy. Here, we knocked out NKG2A, an immune checkpoint expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and differentiated these hPSCs into NK (PSC-NK) cells. We show that NKG2A knockout (KO) enhances the anti-tumor and anti-viral capabilities of PSC-NK cells. NKG2A KO endows PSC-NK cells with higher cytotoxicity against HLA-E-expressing glioblastoma (GBM) cells, leukemia cells, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected cells in vitro. The NKG2A KO PSC-NK cells also exerted potent anti-tumor activity in vivo, leading to substantially suppressed tumor progression and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice in a xenograft GBM mouse model. These findings underscore the potential of PSC-NK cells with immune checkpoint KO as a promising cell-based immunotherapy. The unlimited supply and ease of genetic engineering of hPSCs makes genetically engineered PSC-NK an attractive option for easily accessible \"off-the-shelf\" cancer immunotherapy. ","Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations within nibrin (NBN), a DNA damage repair protein. Hallmarks of NBS include chromosomal instability and clinical manifestations such as growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and progressive microcephaly. We employed induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids from two NBS patients to study the etiology of microcephaly. We show that NBS organoids carrying the homozygous 657del5 NBN mutation are significantly smaller with disrupted cyto-architecture. The organoids exhibit premature differentiation, and Neuronatin (NNAT) over-expression. Furthermore, pathways related to DNA damage response and cell cycle are differentially regulated compared to controls. After exposure to bleomycin, NBS organoids undergo delayed p53-mediated DNA damage response and aberrant trans-synaptic signaling, which ultimately leads to neuronal apoptosis. Our data provide insights into how mutations within NBN alters neurogenesis in NBS patients, thus providing a proof of concept that cerebral organoids are a valuable tool for studying DNA damage-related disorders.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis is a form of chronic liver inflammation associated with metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Multi-biotics, a soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria, are known to alleviate obesity by lowering lipid profile. In this study, we investigated efficacy of multi-biotics in MASH-related HCC using mouse model fed choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet, and determined that tumor regression was not affected by multi-biotics. We established mouse MASH-related HCC organoids, and performed RNA-sequencing to identify transcriptomic features in MASH-HCC treated multi-biotics. We also examined response of MASH-related HCC to four HCC treatment drugs, and MASH-related HCC treated multi-biotics was good response to Lenvatinib. We established Lenvatinib-resistant MASH-related HCC organoids by administrating repeatedly Lenvatinib, and identified enriched pathways in Lenvatinib-resistant models. This study provides a tool for studying MASH-related HCC treatment and Lenvatinib resistance by establishing the MASH-related HCC and Lenvatinib resistance organoid model.","The Long-read POG dataset comprises a cohort of 189 patient tumours and 41 matched normal samples sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION platform. This dataset from the Personalized Oncogenomics (POG) program and the Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres Network includes accompanying DNA and RNA short-read sequence data, analytics, and clinical information. We show the potential of long-read sequencing for resolving complex cancer-related structural variants, viral integrations, and extrachromosomal circular DNA. Long-range phasing of variants facilitates the discovery of allelically differentially methylated regions (aDMRs) and allele-specific expression, including recurrent aDMRs in the cancer genes RET and CDKN2A. Germline promoter methylation in MLH1 can be directly observed in Lynch syndrome. Promoter methylation in BRCA1 and RAD51C is a likely driver behind patterns of homologous recombination deficiency where no driver mutation was found. This dataset demonstrates applications for long-read sequencing in precision medicine, and is available as a resource for developing analytical approaches using this technology.","KIF1A, a microtubule-based motor protein responsible for axonal transport, is linked to a group of neurological disorders known as KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND). Current therapeutic options for KAND are limited. Here, we introduced the clinically relevant KIF1A(R11Q) variant into the C. elegans homolog UNC-104, resulting in uncoordinated animal behaviors. Through genetic suppressor screens, we identified intragenic mutations in UNC-104's motor domain that rescued synaptic vesicle localization and coordinated movement. We showed that two suppressor mutations partially recovered motor activity in vitro by counteracting the structural defect caused by R11Q at KIF1A's nucleotide-binding pocket. We found that supplementation with fisetin, a plant flavonol, improved KIF1A(R11Q) worms’ movement and morphology. Notably, our biochemical and single-molecule assays revealed that fisetin directly restored the ATPase activity and processive movement of human KIF1A(R11Q) without affecting wild-type KIF1A. These findings suggest fisetin as a potential intervention for enhancing KIF1A(R11Q) activity and alleviating associated defects in KAND.","Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is among the major global causes for vision loss. With the rise in diabetes prevalence, an increase in DR incidence is expected. Current understanding of both the molecular etiology and pathways involved in the initiation and progression of DR is limited. Here we analyzed mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of 80 human post-mortem retinal samples from 80 patients diagnosed with various stages of DR. We found differentially expressed transcripts to be predominantly associated with late stage DR and pathways such as hippo and gap junction signaling. A multivariate regression model identified transcripts with progressive changes throughout disease stages, which in turn displayed significant overlap with sphingolipid and cGMP−PKG signaling. Combined analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression further uncovered disease-relevant miRNA/mRNA associations as potential mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, integrating human retinal single cell RNA-Sequencing data revealed a continuous loss of retinal ganglion cells, and Müller cell mediated changes in histidine and β-alanine signaling. Our findings offer an unprecedented insight into the development of DR and provide potential avenues for future therapeutic intervention.","Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is among the major global causes for vision loss.

By using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we recently established BV-2 microglial cell models to study the impact of dysfunctional peroxisomal b-oxidation and demonstrated the emergence of a disease-associated microglial signature in these cell lines. Their transcriptomic analysis suggested consequences on immune response. To go further, we have used RNA-sequencing and functional assays related to immune response to compare the WT and mutant BV-2 cell lines in basal conditions or upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.","Here, we report the characterization and the comparison of the transcriptomes of BV-2 murine microglial mutant cell lines (CRISPR/Cas9-edited mutations in peroxisomal genes) by RNA-sequencing. Microglia is  suspected to play a major role in the neurodegenerative processes observed in peroxisomal leukodystrophies. From CRISPR/Cas9-edited BV-2 microglial cell lines, we aimed at exploring the transcriptomic consequences of a defect of peroxisomal beta-oxidation.","In order to find the molecular mechanism of FRMD3 in stemness regulation, we knocked down FRMD3 in MCF-7 and T47D luminal A breast cancer cell lines for RNA sequencing.","Luminal to basal transition in mammary gland is accompanied by the changes of epithelial cell lineage plasticity, however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that loss of the scaffold protein FRMD3 in breast cancer predicts poor outcomes. Knockout of Frmd3 inhibits mammary gland lineage development and induces mammary epithelium cells (MECs) stemness, and later on emerge of TNBC. Loss of Frmd3 in PyMT mice results in luminal to basal phenotype transition. Single- MEC mRNA sequencing analysis indicated that knockout of Frmd3 corresponds to inhibition of Notch signaling pathway. Mechanistically, FRMD3 assists Dishevelled-2 degradation via enhancing its interaction with the deubiquitinase USP9x. FRMD3 also interrupts the interaction of Dishevelled-2 with CK1, FOXK1, FOXK2 and NICD, causing a decrease in Dishevelled-2 phosphorylation, entry into the nucleus and impairing the Notch-dependent luminal epithelial lineage plasticity in MECs respectively. Taken together, FRMD3 is a tumor suppressor and an endogenous activator of the Notch signaling pathway that regulates mammary epithelial cell lineage plasticity.","T lymphocytes are pivotal in adaptive immunity. The role of trafficking protein particle complex (TRAPPC) in regulating T cell development and homeostasis are unknown. Using CD4cre-Trappc1flox/flox (Trappc1 cKO) mice, we found that Trappc1 deficiency in T cells significantly decreased cell number of naïve T cells in the periphery, whereas thymic T cell development in Trappc1 cKO mice was identical as in WT mice. In the culture assays and mouse models with adoptive transfer of the sorted WT (CD45.1+CD45.2+) and Trappc1 cKO naive T cells (CD45.2+) to CD45.1+ syngeneic mice, Trappc1-deficienct naive T cells showed significantly reduced survival ability compared with WT cells. RNA-seq and molecular studies showed that Trappc1 deficiency in naive T cells reduced protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus, enhanced unfolded protein responses, increased P53 transcription, intracellular Ca2+, Atf4-CHOP, oxidative phosphorylation and lipid peroxide accumulation, and subsequently led to ferroptosis.","We sequenced 8 colorectal cancer patients' PBMC samples, and 6 healthy donors' PBMC samples.

For efficacy, the recombinant genes need to be highly expressed, but this imposes a burden on the cell, and plasmids are difficult to maintain in the body. To address these problems, we have developed landing pads in the EcN genome and genetic circuits to control therapeutic gene expression. These tools were applied to EcN SYNB1618, undergoing clinical trials as a phenylketonuria treatment. The pathway for converting phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid was moved to a landing pad under the control of a circuit that keeps the pathway off during storage. The resulting strain (EcN SYN8784) achieved higher activity than EcN SYNB1618, reaching levels near when the pathway is carried on a plasmid. This work demonstrates a simple system for engineering EcN that aids quantitative strain design for therapeutics.","Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) play essential roles in controlling development and metabolism, its mutations are clearly linked to the occurrence of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3) in human. 117 lysine to glutamic acid (E117) mutation in the HNF1α gene was clinically associated with MOYD3, but no functional data on this variant is available. Here, we generated a knock-in mouse model in which the lysine 117 is replaced with glutamic acid in the endogenous murine HNF1α locus. The HNF1αE117/E117 mice reproduced HNF1-null phenotypes including dwarfism, hepatic dysfunction, renal Fanconi syndrome, diabetes and die from a progressive wasting syndrome, but no hyperphenylalaninemia. Moreover, HNF1αE117/E117 mice shared similar hepatic gene expression profiles with HNF1 deficient mice. In vitro  experiments showed that HNF1 mutants in which the lysine 117 residue were replaced by glutamic acid, arginine or glutamine residues, respectively, had a significant decreased in overall transactivation and DNA binding capacity. K117 mutants had no effect on its protein stabilities and nuclear localization, but significantly blocked its own association. Our results clearly demonstrate that the lysine 117 residue is essential for the function of the HNF1a, and prove important to identify the molecular basis for diseases associated with defects in HNF1α We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of liver tissue of 3 WT mice and 3 KI mice.","By comparing the multi-omics profile of human NK cells before and after G-CSF in vivo treatment, we identified a pathway that was activated in response to G-CSF treatment, which suppressed IFN-γ secretion in NK cells. Specifically, integrative genomic strategy uncovered that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was activated and mediated the genomic response to G-CSF treatment in NK cells. Activated GR can inhibit secretion of IFN-γ via promoting interactions between suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) promoter and enhancer and increase the expression of SOCS1.","Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are involved in controlling tumors or microbial infections through the production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ).

However, correction of a disease phenotype in vivo in somatic tissues has not been achieved yet. Here, we establish proof-of-concept for in vivo prime editing, that resulted in rescue of a metabolic liver disease. We first develop a size-reduced prime editor (PE) lacking the RNaseH domain of the reverse transcriptase (SpCas9-PERnH), and a linker- and NLS-optimized intein-split PE construct (SpCas9-PE p.1153) for delivery by adeno-associated viruses (AAV). Systemic dual AAV-mediated delivery of this variant in neonatal mice enables installation of a transversion mutation at the Dnmt1 locus with 15% efficiency on average. Next, we targeted the disease-causing mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (Pah)enu2 mouse model for phenylketonuria (PKU). Correction rates of 1.5% using the dual AAV approach could be increased to up to 14% by delivery of full-length SpCas9-PE via adenoviral vector 5 (AdV5), leading to full restoration of physiological blood phenylalanine (L-Phe) levels below 120 µmol/L. Our study demonstrates in vivo prime editing in the liver at two independent loci, emphasizing the potential of PEs for future therapeutic applications.","Background: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. Patients with mild or moderate PKU can be successfully treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride (SD) which since recently is registered for usage from the age of 4 months. SD is a pharmaceutical version of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor of PAH. Similar BH4 concentrations to those observed in plasma have been found in CSF of patients after a single oral administration thus proving that SD crosses the BBB. Hyperactivity has recently been reported as a post-marketing observation in some PKU patients treated with SD. Methods: 60 or 120 ng/ml sepiapterin, a stable precursor of BH4, were applied to study the effects of BH4 on developing brain cells in 3D organotypic rat brain cell cultures at two developmental stages. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, metabolomics and RNA sequencing were performed. Findings: BH4 and BH2 measurements confirmed a successful conversion of sepiapterin to the active form BH4. In the earlier developmental stage, brain cell specific markers showed swollen astrocytes and diminished astrocytic fibres, delayed differentiation of oligodendrocytes and perturbation of axonal elongation. Immunofluorescence for activated caspase-3 revealed an increased apoptosis rate. We also found signs of perturbated GABAergic neurotransmission. RNAseq analyses revealed a number of significantly affected genes. GO enrichment allowed to identify key biological processes. Interestingly, none of these effects was observed in the later developmental stage. We show deleterious effects of SD on developing brain cells in a rat in vitro model. This observation raises the question whether the use of SD can be recommended in very young PKU patients as currently licensed.","Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) plays a crucial role in controlling growth of mycobacteria, presumed to be via nitric oxide (NO) mediated killing. However, NOS enzymes can also signal through NO-independent pathways, and production of NO by NOS requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).  We compared Nos2-/- mice to mice with macrophage BH4 deficiency (Gch1fl/flTie2cre), due to a leukocyte-specific deletion of Gch1, to uncover the specific contribution of NO-independent NOS functions to anti-mycobacterial immunity. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in uninfected and BCG infected macrophages that were either deficient in iNOS (Nos2-/- vs C57bl6/J) or BH4/Gch1 (GCHfl/flTie2cre vs GCHfl/fl)","Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for several metabolic enzymes, including the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, alkylglycerol mono-oxygenase and NO synthases. BH4 deficiency due to an autosomal recessive defect in its biosynthetic enzyme 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS, encoded by the PTS gene) leads to a variant form of hyperphenylalaninemia concomitant with severe deficiency of brain monoamine neurotransmitters. In contrast, augmentation of BH4 by pharmacological supplementation or stimulation of its biosynthesis is thought to correct eNOS dysfunction, to protect from (cardio) vascular disease and/or to prevent from abdominal obesity and development of the metabolic syndrome. We have previously reported that complete Pts knock-out (ko) mice die after birth (Elzaouk et al JBC 2003). Here we generated a murine Pts-knock-in (ki) allele expressing a PTPS-p.Arg15Cys mutant enzyme with low residual activity (12% of wild-type in vitro) and investigated heterozygous Pts-ko/wt, homozygous Pts-ki/ki and compound heterozygous Pts-ki/ko mutant mice. All mice were viable and, depending on the severity of the Pts alleles, exhibited up to 90% reduction of PTPS activity in liver and brain tissues concomitant with high neopterin, but neither an elevation of blood L-Phe, nor a decrease in brain monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine or serotonin. Upon a standard systemic and comprehensive phenotyping of Pts-ki/ki mice, we found alterations in energy metabolites with reduced body mass, higher fat content, lower lean mass, and increased blood glucose and cholesterol in mutant animals. Furthermore, heterozygous Pts-ko/wt and/or homozygous Pts-ki/ki mice exhibited increased body weight and elevated intra-abdominal fat tissue when fed with normal chow or high fat diet. We conclude that a reduced BH4-biosynthetic activity in mice leads to abnormal body fat distribution and abdominal obesity potentially through a mildly compromised eNOS function.","The goal of this study is to compare the transcriptome of heart failure patients (with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy) undergoing heart transplantation compared with healthy controls.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","HOIL1 deficient disease is a new early onset fatal autosomal recessive human disorder charaterized by chronic auto-inflammation, recurrent invasive bacterial infections and progressive muscular amylopectinosis. We studied the transcriptional profiles of whole blood from one HOIL dificient patient and other auto-inflammatory patients, including CINCA, Muckle-Wells syndrome and MVK deficiency.","Chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome is an IL-1-driven autoinflammatory disorder caused mainly by NLRP3 mutations. The pathogenesis of CINCA syndrome patients who carry NLRP3 mutations as somatic mosaicism has not been precisely described because of the difficulty in separating individual cells based on the presence or absence of the mutation. Here, we report the generation of NLRP3-mutant and non-mutant induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from two CINCA syndrome patients with somatic mosaicism, and describe their differentiation into macrophages (iPS-MPs). We found that mutant cells are predominantly responsible for the pathogenesis in these mosaic patients because only mutant iPS-MPs showed the disease relevant phenotype of abnormal IL-1β secretion. We also confirmed that the existing anti-inflammatory compounds inhibited the abnormal IL-1β secretion, indicating that mutant iPS-MPs are applicable for drug screening for CINCA syndrome and other NLRP3-related inflammatory conditions. Our results illustrate that patient-derived iPSCs are useful for dissecting somatic mosaicism, and that NLRP3-mutant iPSCs can provide a valuable platform for drug discovery for multiple NLRP3-related disorders.","Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html  The GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array is accessioned in GEO as GPL8321.

Cell-type-specific RNA-Seq analyses of the developing neocortex uncover variable expression of the Rbfox1/2/3 genes and enriched splicing events in transcription regulators, altering protein isoforms or inducing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Transient expression of Rbfox proteins in radial glial progenitors induces neuronal splicing events preferentially in transcription regulators such as Meis2 and Tead1. Surprisingly, Rbfox proteins promote the inclusion of a mammal-specific alternative exon and a previously undescribed poison exon in Ptbp1. Simultaneous ablation of Rbfox1/2/3 in the neocortex downregulates neuronal isoforms and disrupts radial neuronal migration. Furthermore, the progenitor isoform of Meis2 promotes Tgfb3 transcription, while the Meis2 neuron isoform promotes neuronal differentiation. These observations indicate that transcription regulators are differentially spliced between cell types in the developing neocortex.","The intestinal mucosal barrier is a dynamic system that allows nutrient uptake, stimulates healthy microbe-host interactions, and prevents invasion by pathogens. The mucosa consists of epithelial cells connected by cellular junctions that regulate the passage of nutrients covered by a mucus layer that plays an important role in host-microbiome interactions. Mimicking the intestinal mucosa for in vitro assays, in particular the generation of a viscous mucus layer, has proven to be challenging. Here, we present a novel in vitro intestinal culture model that produces a robust mucus layer and is based on the widely used intestinal Caco-2 cell line. We investigated the effects of air-liquid interface (ALI) culturing compared to liquid-liquid interface (LLI) on Caco-2 cells grown under low-glucose conditions in Transwell plates. In addition, we determined the impact of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) on mucus secretion, epithelial barrier properties and microbe-mucus interactions. A combination of ALI culturing with VIP addition led to formation of a robust mucus layer on the apical surface of the Caco-2 confluent layer in which the intestinal secreted mucin MUC2 was a major component. RNAseq analysis demonstrated upregulation of unique gene clusters in response to ALI and VIP conditions, but the ALI-VIP combination treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of multiple mucin genes and proteins including MUC2, MUC13 and MUC17. Expression of tight junction proteins was significantly altered in the ALI-VIP condition leading to increased permeability to small molecules, more closely reflecting an intestinal epithelium permissive for nutrient uptake. In infection experiments with commensal Lactobacillus plantarum, pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the ALI-VIP mucus layer separated the bacteria from the underlying epithelium. In conclusion, ALI-VIP culture of Caco-2 cells provides an attractive in vitro model to study the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier and pathogenic and commensal microbe-host interactions.","Nogo-A is a major regulator of neural development and regeneration in the central nervous system, but its role in tooth innervation remains largely unknown. Neurons of the trigeminal ganglion innervate the teeth. We showed that Nogo-A is expressed in the trigeminal ganglion and tooth-related nerve fibres. Nogo-A deletion in mice leads to a less complex neuronal network when compared to wild-type animals. Bulk RNA sequencing on the trigeminal ganglia of Nogo-A KO and wild-type mice revealed gene expression changes associated with alterations in neurotrophin signalling and neuronal synaptic formation during the development and maturation of the trigeminal neurons.","B cell somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection in germinal center (GC)s enhance antibody affinity to antigen. Conventional understanding holds that SHM enhances pre-existing antibody specificities, limiting the scope of SHM-based antibody evolution to those established in the primary repertoire through V(D)J recombination. By tracking pre-defined non-specific B cells, we observed consistent SHM in non-cognate antibody genes after immunization in settings of diverse, polyclonal B and T cells. Removing B cell competition enabled these non-specific yet somatically mutating antibodies to develop entirely new specificities to diverse antigens. Our findings introduce an updated model, where SHM drives antibody diversification without requiring initial antigen specificity. This reveals that B cell competition, rather than a necessity for specific affinity, limits the emergence of new affinities (termed here as affinity birth) by SHM and highlights the mammalian adaptive immune system’s capacity to explore antibody-antigen interactions beyond the epitopes targeted by the V(D)J-dependent primary antibody repertoire.","Introduction: Skeletal muscle satellite cells (MuSCs, or stem cells) play a crucial role in muscle development, maintenance, and regeneration, serving both hypertrophic support and regenerative myogenesis. Syndecans (SDCs) act as communication bridges within the muscle microenvironment, regulating interactions with extracellular matrix components, and contributing significantly to tissue repair and inflammation. Specifically, syndecan-4 (SDC4) is involved in muscle regeneration at multiple stages. Methods: This study delves into the emerging challenge of wooden breast (WB) myopathy and its connection to SDC4. Our hypothesis proposes that disruptions in MuSC dynamics through SDC4 contribute to the increased incidence of breast myopathies observed in growing broilers. To test our hypothesis, non-affected and affected broilers were systematically selected, and the characteristics of WB myopathy were studied both in vitro and in vivo. SDC4 overexpression in MuSCs and blocking peptides corresponding to the SDC4 ectodomain were used for investigation of the role of SDC4 in muscle development and its shedding levels. Results and Discussion: Examination in vivo of affected muscles revealed smaller fibers and changes in metabolic pathways. In vitro studies unveiled disrupted proliferation of MuSCs in WB myopathy, accompanied by downregulation of several muscle markers. Investigation of a potentially role of SDC4 in the pathogenesis of WB myopathy revealed a decreased tendency in SDC4 gene expression and increased shedding of its ectodomain. Moreover, we showed that SDC4 overexpression is linked to decreased proliferation in MuSCs and affected myogenesis. We detected the impairment proliferation of WB-affected MuSCs, revealing critical insights into the dysfunctional state of these cells in myopathy. Additionally, by treating MuSCs with blocking peptides derived from the SDC4 ectodomain, we identified altered proliferation.  Taken together, this work contributes valuable knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying WB myopathy and role of SDC4 in this chicken myopathy.","The activation of fibroblasts and production of extracellular matrix (ECM) after cardiac injury has been the focus of research on cardiac fibrosis. Whether imprinted genes play a role in the fibrogenesis or extracellular matrix production after heart damage has not been studied. Here, we show that the imprinted gene Pw1 directed ECM production by regulating de novo purine synthesis (DNPB) after myocardial infarction (MI). After MI, the DNA methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) of Pw1 gene in the injured area was reduced and both alleles of Pw1 in fibroblasts are activated. Further, loss of Pw1 in fibroblasts can enhance cardiac function, reduce cardiac fibrosis and extracellular matrix secretion after cardiac injury. To screen the targets of PW1, we contrasted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and RNA-seq using the injured left ventricles at 7 days post-MI, we next found PW1 binds directly upstream of the Pfas gene that encodes one of the DNPB enzymes phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS) in heart after injury. Similarly, specific knockout of pfas in fibroblasts also improves cardiac function and reduces ECM production. Moreover, de novo purine biosynthesis is necessary for ECM production in activated fibroblasts. These observations implicate understanding the mechanism of Pw1 in the repair of cardiac injury will provide new ideas for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Gene regulatory mechanisms that modulate RNA Polymerase II activity are difficult to access in mammalian tissues composed of multiple cell lineages. Here, we develop a nascent RNA assay (PReCIS-seq) that measures lineage-specific transcriptionally-engaged Pol II on genes and DNA enhancer elements in intact mouse tissue.

Moreover, we relate active enhancer proximity and transcription factor binding motifs on promoters to Pol II activity and promoter-proximal pausing level. Finally, we find Pol II firing rapidly into elongation on lineage identity genes and highly paused on cellular safeguarding genes in a context-dependent manner.

We recently assessed in two clinical trials in a preventative setting whether immunity induced with a MUC1 peptide vaccine could reduce high colon cancer risk in individuals with a history of premalignant colon adenomas. In both trials, there were immune responders and non-responders to the vaccine. Here we used PBMC pre-vaccination and 2 weeks after the first vaccine of responders and non-responders selected from both trials to identify early biomarkers of immune response involved in longterm memory generation and prevention of adenoma recurrence. We performed flow cytometry, phosflow, and differential gene expression analyses on PBMCs collected from MUC1 vaccine responders and non-responders pre-vaccination and two weeks after the first of three vaccine doses. MUC1 vaccine responders had higher frequencies of CD4 cells pre-vaccination, increased expression of CD40L on CD8 and CD4 T-cells, and a greater increase in ICOS expression on CD8 T-cells. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that iCOSL, PI3K AKT MTOR, and B-cell signaling pathways are activated early in response to the MUC1 vaccine. We identified six specific transcripts involved in elevated antigen presentation, B-cell activation, and NF-kB1 activation that were directly linked to finding antibody response at week 12. Finally, a model using these transcripts was able to predict non-responders with accuracy. These findings suggest that individuals who can be predicted to respond to the MUC1 vaccine, and potentially other vaccines, have greater readiness in all immune compartments to present and respond to antigens. Predictive biomarkers of MUC1 vaccine response may lead to more effective vaccines tailored to individuals with high risk for cancer but with varying immune fitness.","Immunotherapies have had unprecedented success for multiple cancer types, albeit with variable response rates. Unravelling the complex network of immune cells within the tumour microenvironment (TME) may provide additional insights to enhance anti-tumour immunity and improve clinical response. Here, we identified a CD103-expressing CD56+ ILC subset that were associated with a poor proliferative capacity of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in culture. We demonstrate that CD103+CD56+ ILCs isolated directly from tumors represent a distinct ILC population that expressed unique surface markers, transcription factor networks, and transcriptomic profiles compared to CD103-CD56+ NK cells. Using multiple approaches, we found that these CD103+CD56+ ILCs were associated with CD8+ T cells with a reduced expression of GZMB. This study identifies 59 a population of CD103+CD56+ ILCs with potentially inhibitory functions, that are associated with a TME that includes CD8+ T cells with poor anti-tumour activity. Further studies focusing on these potentially inhibitory cells may provide insights into understanding the biology of an inhibitory TME.","Dyrk1A deficiency is linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delays, intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Haploinsufficiency of Dyrk1a in mice reportedly leads to ASD-related phenotypes. However, the key pathological mechanisms remain unclear and human DYRK1A mutations remain uncharacterized in mice. Here, we generated and studied Dyrk1a-knockin mice carrying a human ASD patient mutation (Ile48LysfsX2; Dyrk1a-I48K mice). These mice display severe microcephaly, social and cognitive deficits, dendritic shrinkage, excitatory synaptic deficits, and altered phospho-proteomic patterns enriched for multiple signaling pathways and synaptic proteins.","Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a pivotal component of the tumor microenvironment, significantly contributing to the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Direct co-culture of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one of the origins of CAFs, with ESCC cell line, led to increased amphiregulin (AREG) expression and secretion in the ESCC cells. Consequently, the expression and phosphorylation of the AREG receptor EGFR were upregulated in co-cultured ESCC cells. Moreover, AREG treatment enhanced ESCC cell survival and migration through the EGFR-Erk/p38 signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis of AREG using human ESCC tissues showed a positive correlation between the intensity of AREG expression in tumor invasive front and the expression level of the CAF marker FAP. Furthermore, bioinformatics database analysis confirmed a significant upregulation of AREG expression in ESCC tissues compared to normal tissues. These findings suggest that AREG is involved in CAF-mediated ESCC progression and could be a novel therapeutic target for ESCC.","Moderating the pool of active ribosomal subunits is critical for maintaining global translation rates. A crucial factor for modulating the 60S ribosomal subunits is eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6. Release of eIF6 from 60S is essential to permit 60S interactions with 40S. Here, using the N106S mutant of eIF6, we show that disrupting eIF6 interaction with 60S leads to an increase in vacant 80S. It further highlights a dichotomy in the anti-association activity of eIF6 that is distinct from its role in 60S biogenesis and shows that the nucleolar localization of eIF6 is not dependent on uL14-BCCIP interactions. Limiting active ribosomal pools markedly deregulates translation especially in mitosis and leads to chromosome segregation defects, mitotic exit delays and mitotic catastrophe. Ribo-Seq analysis of the eIF6-N106S mutant shows a significant downregulation in the translation efficiencies of mitotic factors and specifically transcripts with long 3′UTRs. eIF6-N106S mutation also limits cancer invasion, and this role is correlated with the overexpression of eIF6 only in high-grade invasive cancers suggesting that deregulation of eIF6 is probably not an early event in cancers. Thus, this study highlights the segregation of eIF6 functions and its role in moderating 80S availability for mitotic translation and cancer progression.","Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction caused by obesity can be associated with alterations in the levels of microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the role of miRNAs in such processes remains elusive. Here, we show that pancreatic islet miR-27a-5p, which is markedly increased in obese mice and impairs insulin secretion, is mainly delivered by visceral adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Depleting miR-27a-5p significantly improves insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in db/db mice. Supporting the function of EVs’ miR-27a-5p as a key pathogenic factor, intravenous injection of miR-27a-5p-containing EVs shows their distribution in mouse pancreatic islets. Tracing the injected AAV-miR-27a-5p (AAV-miR-27a) or AAV-FABP4-miR-27a-5p (AAV-FABP4-miR-27a) in visceral fat results in upregulating miR-27a-5p in EVs and serum, and elicits mouse pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, miR-27a-5p directly targets L-type Ca2+ channel subtype CaV1.2 (Cacna1c) and reduces insulin secretion in β-cells. Overexpressing mouse CaV1.2 largely abolishes the insulin secretion injury induced by miR-27a-5p. These findings reveal a causative role of EVs’ miR-27a-5p in visceral adipocyte-mediated pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Cancer cells disseminated to distant sites enter a period of dormancy before generating overt metastases. The ability of these cells to elude immune surveillance determines their persistence as latent disease. We report that TGF-β promotes dormancy in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mouse models by placing disseminated SOX2+ and NKX2-1+ progenitors in a quiescent state that biomechanically averts killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. In these primitive progenitors, TGF-β induces an atypical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β drives expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin that changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the stiffness of metastatic progenitors and their killing by mechanosensitive CTLs and NK cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors activate a biomechanical process to evade immune-mediated elimination during prolonged dormancy periods. Inhibiting this process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells.","Chronic arsenic exposure can lead to various health issues including cancer. There has been a growing concern about co-exposure to various prevalent lifestyle habits and their role in the enhancement of arsenic toxicity. Smokeless tobacco (SLT) products are extensively consumed in many South Asian countries, where their use frequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To decipher the oral epithelial cell responses to arsenic and SLT alone and in co-exposure, we performed multi-omics analyses of DNA methylome, transcriptomic reprogramming and genotoxic effects in controlled experimental settings. Chronic exposure studies revealed hypomethylation of genes involved in inflammation response and apoptosis, further corroborated by the upregulation of genes involved in these processes due to arsenic and the combined treatment in acute exposure setting. Next, to validate the omics results at the phenotypic level, we observed a dose dependent decrease in cell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes, and an increase in apoptotic cells, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT co-exposure conditions. The observed DNA damage was likely the result of apoptosis induction, as chronic exposure experiments based on whole-exome sequencing did not reveal increased mutagenicity following the arsenic and/or SLT exposure. Our integrative omics study provides insights into both chronic and acute responses to arsenic and SLT co-exposure, with both types of responses converging on some of the same mechanisms. We identified large-scale epigenomic and transcriptomic reprograming associated with arsenic and SLT co-exposure, alongside genotoxic effects presumably manifesting as consequences of apoptosis induction. The findings point to a role of arsenic and SLT in altering key molecular responses, especially in the context of the co-exposure, and call for further studies in humans in the areas of exposure, to validate the observed mechanisms.","The coordinate regulation of metabolic activity and epigenetics to establish cell state-specific gene expression patterns during lineage progression is among the most important aspects of cell differentiation. Cell states are defined by their epigenetic landscape and have cell state-specific metabolic demands. Defining the regulatory factors involved in the interplay between metabolism and cell state would represent a significant step forward in understanding the genetic circuitry that drives differentiation of progenitor cells into highly specialized cell types for proper tissue formation. Expression levels of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) mega-cluster have been shown to correlate with distinct metabolic profiles in a variety of progenitor cells, suggesting it functions as a key regulator of metabolism and cell state. Here, we directly demonstrate that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a central player coordinating mitochondrial metabolic activity and genome-wide epigenetic changes in myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Stable muscle cell lines were generated harboring two distinct deletions in the proximal promoter region resulting in either greatly upregulated or severely attenuated transcription of the entire mega-cluster of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. Both mutant lines displayed impaired myotube formation along with perturbed mitochondrial respiration and widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and histone methylation. Global gene expression patterns and pathway analyses indicated a reprogramming of cell state which created a differentiated-like molecular profile in proliferating myoblasts. Our results strongly suggest that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a nodal regulator coordinating metabolic activity and the epigenome to maintain proper cell state in the myogenic lineage.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","This study investigates how master splicing regulators interact and the extent to which transcription regulators are spliced differently during brain development. Cell-type-specific RNA-Seq analyses of the developing neocortex uncover variable expression of the Rbfox1/2/3 genes and enriched splicing events in transcription regulators, altering protein isoforms or inducing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Transient expression of Rbfox proteins in radial glial progenitors induces neuronal splicing events preferentially in transcription regulators such as Meis2 and Tead1. Surprisingly, Rbfox proteins promote the inclusion of a mammal-specific alternative exon and a previously undescribed poison exon in Ptbp1. Simultaneous ablation of Rbfox1/2/3 in the neocortex downregulates neuronal isoforms and disrupts radial neuronal migration. Furthermore, the progenitor isoform of Meis2 promotes Tgfb3 transcription, while the Meis2 neuron isoform promotes neuronal differentiation. These observations indicate that transcription regulators are differentially spliced between cell types in the developing neocortex.","Gene regulatory mechanisms that modulate RNA Polymerase II activity are difficult to access in mammalian tissues composed of multiple cell lineages.

Targeting epigenome is thus a promising strategy for cancer chemotherapy. Here we report a novel histone acetylation catalyst BAHA-LANA-PEG-CPP44 that can intervene into cancer epigenome. The catalyst selectively entered leukemia cells, bound to chromatin, and acetylated endogenous histones, especially at H2BK120, in a HAT-independent manner. The catalytic histone acetylation attenuated chromatin binding of negative elongation factor E (NELFE), an RNA polymerase II pausing factor, and reprogramed transcription profile in leukemia cells. The in-cell chemical catalysis retarded proliferation of leukemia cells and reduced their tumorigenic potential in mice. Our catalyst is orthogonal to cancer epigenetic drugs targeting histone-modifying enzymes and may lead to a novel anti-cancer strategy.","Chemical modification of histones dynamically regulates gene transcription and is closely related to disease pathogenesis including cancer.

However, whether and how high-ordered chromatin organization is involved in CD8+ T cell activation is unclear. Here, we showed extensive changes in the three-dimensional genome during CD8+ T cell activation, associated with changes in gene transcription. Moreover, we identified Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) as an essential mediator in re-organization of spatial chromosomal interactions. Trim28 deficiency impaired CD8+ T cell activation in vitro and in vivo, due to its regulation on autocrine IL-2 production. Mechanistically, TRIM28 bound to genes associated with CD8+ T cell activation and promoted the formation of chromosomal loops. At the loop anchor regions, TRIM28 is likely recruited by CTCF, and required for binding of RNA Pol II and cohesin to form active chromosomal structure. These results thus identify a critical role of TRIM28-dependent chromatin topology in gene transcription during CD8+ T cell activation.","MEIS1 and MEIS2 encode highly conserved homeodomain transcription factors crucial for developmental processes in a wide range of tissues, including the brain. They can execute redundant functions when co-expressed in the same cell types, but their roles during early stages of neural differentiation have not been systematically compared. By separate knockout and overexpression of MEIS1 and MEIS2 in human neural stem cells, we find they control specific sets of target genes, associated with distinct biological processes. Integration of DNA binding sites with differential transcriptomics implicates MEIS1 to co-regulate gene expression by interaction with transcription factors of the SOX and FOX families. MEIS1 harbors the strongest risk factor for restless legs syndrome (RLS). Our data suggest that MEIS1 can directly regulate the RLS-associated genes NTNG1, MDGA1 and DACH1, constituting new approaches to study the elusive pathomechanism or RLS.","T cell activation is accompanied by extensive changes in epigenome.

In the adult heart, TCF21 is expressed in tissue resident fibroblasts but is downregulated in response to injury or stimuli leading to myofibroblast differentiation. These findings led to the hypothesis that Tcf21 could be a regulator of fibroblast cell-fate in the adult mammalian heart and contribute to cardiac fibrosis. Here, bulk RNA sequencing was used to determine the effect of loss of TCF21 and enforced TCF21 expression in adult cardiac fibroblasts.

However, whether and how high-ordered chromatin organization is involved in CD8+ T cell activation is unclear. Here, we showed extensive changes in the three-dimensional genome during CD8+ T cell activation, associated with changes in gene transcription. Moreover, we identified Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) as an essential mediator in re-organization of spatial chromosomal interactions. Trim28 deficiency impaired CD8+ T cell activation in vitro and in vivo, due to its regulation on autocrine IL-2 production. Mechanistically, TRIM28 bound to genes associated with CD8+ T cell activation and promoted the formation of chromosomal loops.

ChIP-seq, PRO-seq, TT-seq, or RNA-seq were normalizated by MEF as spike-in.  The reads passed the quality check aligned to the human hg19 and mouse mm10 genome. In this study, samples for each condition were collected in biological duplicates. Cells were treated with dTAG13 for 3,12h, the corresponding control cells were treated with vehicle only (DMSO) at the same vol/vol dilution.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","RNA polymerase II progression from initiation to elongation is driven in part by a cascade of protein kinases acting on the core transcription machinery. Conversely, the corresponding phosphatases, notably PP2A and PP1—the most abundant serine-threonine phosphatases in cells—are thought to mainly impede polymerase progression, respectively restraining pause release at promoters and polymerase elongation at terminators. Here we reveal an unexpected role of PP1, within the PNUTS-PP1 complex, in sustaining global transcriptional activation. Acute disruption of PNUTS-PP1 leads to severe defects in the release of paused polymerase and subsequent downregulation for the majority of transcribed genes. Mechanistically, PNUTS-PP1 promotes pause release by dephosphorylating multiple substrates, including the 7SK snRNP subunit MEPCE, a known regulator of pause release. PNUTS-PP1 exhibits antagonistic functions compared to INTAC phosphatase, which generally inhibits pause release. Our research thus highlights the opposing roles of PP1 and PP2A in modulating genome-wide transcriptional pausing and gene expression.","RNA polymerase II progression from initiation to elongation is driven in part by a cascade of protein kinases acting on the core transcription machinery.

In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria disease is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in malaria in non-immune children and adults, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of innate immune cell responders to malaria parasites in malaria-naïve children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naïve individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ δ T cell responses from adults were characterized by increased inflammatory cytokine production, and higher transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL-10 production and enrichment in IL-10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by regulatory T cells (Tregs). Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.  ","The 5’ end RNA molecules transcribed by RNA polymerase II are known to be modified in human cells. Specifically, A-initiated transcripts can be methylated at both the 2’-O position in the ribose (2’-O-methylation, or cap-1) and the N6-position in the base (N6-methylation). Almost all A-initiated transcripts have the cap-1 modification, however, the N6-methylation is optional. As a result, A-initiated transcripts in the cell can be Am (cap-1 only) or m6Am (cap-1 and N6-methylation) modified. To study m6Am, we developed CROWN-seq, which simultaneously obtains the transcription-start information and the stoichiometry of N6-methyl. With CROWN-seq, we found that the previous m6Am mapping studies highly underestimated the diversity of the transcription-start site (nucleotide) of the transcriptome. In this study, we used CROWN-seq to reveal m6Am sites and stoichiometry among different human cell lines. We demonstrated that m6Am stoichiometry in mRNA is in general high, however, m6Am stoichiometry in snRNA, snoRNA, and their pseudogenes is more variable.","The intestinal mucosal barrier is a dynamic system that allows nutrient uptake, stimulates healthy microbe-host interactions, and prevents invasion by pathogens. The mucosa consists of epithelial cells connected by cellular junctions that regulate the passage of nutrients covered by a mucus layer that plays an important role in host-microbiome interactions. Mimicking the intestinal mucosa for in vitro assays, in particular the generation of a viscous mucus layer, has proven to be challenging. Here, we present a novel in vitro intestinal culture model that produces a robust mucus layer and is based on the widely used intestinal Caco-2 cell line. We investigated the effects of air-liquid interface (ALI) culturing compared to liquid-liquid interface (LLI) on Caco-2 cells grown under low-glucose conditions in Transwell plates. In addition, we determined the impact of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) on mucus secretion, epithelial barrier properties and microbe-mucus interactions. A combination of ALI culturing with VIP addition led to formation of a robust mucus layer on the apical surface of the Caco-2 confluent layer in which the intestinal secreted mucin MUC2 was a major component. RNAseq analysis demonstrated upregulation of unique gene clusters in response to ALI and VIP conditions, but the ALI-VIP combination treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of multiple mucin genes and proteins including MUC2, MUC13 and MUC17. Expression of tight junction proteins was significantly altered in the ALI-VIP condition leading to increased permeability to small molecules, more closely reflecting an intestinal epithelium permissive for nutrient uptake. In infection experiments with commensal Lactobacillus plantarum, pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the ALI-VIP mucus layer separated the bacteria from the underlying epithelium. In conclusion, ALI-VIP culture of Caco-2 cells provides an attractive in vitro model to study the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier and pathogenic and commensal microbe-host interactions.","Hypoxia tolerance is mainly controlled by the hypoxia signaling pathway and HIF-1α/2α serve as master regulators in this pathway. Here we identify MYLIP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase thought to specifically target lipoprotein receptors, as a negative regulator of HIF-1α/2α. MYLIP interacts with HIF-1α/2α and catalyzes K27-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 118/442 (HIF-1α) or lysine 117 (HIF-2α). This modification induces proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α, resulting in inhibition of hypoxia signaling. Furthermore, Mylip-deficient bluntsnout bream, zebrafish and mice are more tolerant to hypoxia. These findings reveal a role for MYLIP in regulating hypoxia signaling and identify a target for developing fish strains with high hypoxia tolerance for the benefit of the","Stress susceptibility varies across individuals, influenced by genetic, molecular, and environmental factors. Considering the individual differences in response to stress, however, approaches for exercise treatment as an antidepressant and anxiolytic intervention are also not exempt from variability in effectiveness among individuals, and insight into the biology of those variations can be gained by examining the individual adaptation to exercise. Here, we investigated the efficacy of voluntary wheel running (VWR) exercise as a disease-modifying intervention for stress-susceptible (SS) mice subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRST). Multidimensional behavior analysis revealed significant variability in the efficacy of VWR among individuals, with some mice showing substantial behavior phenotypic improvements (e.g., behavior despair, anhedonia, aversion to open space, and compulsive behavior) (SES) while others displayed limited or no benefits (SER). Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), a critical brain region involved in emotional regulation and processing, demonstrated that SES mice exhibited molecular signatures promoting adaptive changes by restoring cellular repair, energy availability, and synaptic plasticity observed in SS mice, whereas SER mice exhibited limited behavior resilience and distinct transcriptomic profiles enriched in structural adaptation without functional resilience and glia cell differentiation, particularly marked by astrocyte activation or differentiation. These findings suggest that while VWR can alleviate multiple concurrent behavior symptoms in stress-susceptible mice; however, its efficacy is influenced by distinct biological processes. Collectively, our work highlights the importance of a multivariate framework for behavior assessment and genetic underpinnings to better understand the often-overlooked variability in response to stress and the therapeutic efficacy of exercise in stress-related disorders.","B cell somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection in germinal center (GC)s enhance antibody affinity to antigen. Conventional understanding holds that SHM enhances pre-existing antibody specificities, limiting the scope of SHM-based antibody evolution to those established in the primary repertoire through V(D)J recombination. By tracking pre-defined non-specific B cells, we observed consistent SHM in non-cognate antibody genes after immunization in settings of diverse, polyclonal B and T cells. Removing B cell competition enabled these non-specific yet somatically mutating antibodies to develop entirely new specificities to diverse antigens. Our findings introduce an updated model, where SHM drives antibody diversification without requiring initial antigen specificity. This reveals that B cell competition, rather than a necessity for specific affinity, limits the emergence of new affinities (termed here as affinity birth) by SHM and highlights the mammalian adaptive immune system’s capacity to explore antibody-antigen interactions beyond the epitopes targeted by the V(D)J-dependent primary antibody repertoire.","Self-antigens abnormally expressed on tumors, such as MUC1, have been targeted by therapeutic cancer vaccines. We recently assessed in two clinical trials in a preventative setting whether immunity induced with a MUC1 peptide vaccine could reduce high colon cancer risk in individuals with a history of premalignant colon adenomas. In both trials, there were immune responders and non-responders to the vaccine. Here we used PBMC pre-vaccination and 2 weeks after the first vaccine of responders and non-responders selected from both trials to identify early biomarkers of immune response involved in longterm memory generation and prevention of adenoma recurrence. We performed flow cytometry, phosflow, and differential gene expression analyses on PBMCs collected from MUC1 vaccine responders and non-responders pre-vaccination and two weeks after the first of three vaccine doses. MUC1 vaccine responders had higher frequencies of CD4 cells pre-vaccination, increased expression of CD40L on CD8 and CD4 T-cells, and a greater increase in ICOS expression on CD8 T-cells. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that iCOSL, PI3K AKT MTOR, and B-cell signaling pathways are activated early in response to the MUC1 vaccine. We identified six specific transcripts involved in elevated antigen presentation, B-cell activation, and NF-kB1 activation that were directly linked to finding antibody response at week 12. Finally, a model using these transcripts was able to predict non-responders with accuracy. These findings suggest that individuals who can be predicted to respond to the MUC1 vaccine, and potentially other vaccines, have greater readiness in all immune compartments to present and respond to antigens. Predictive biomarkers of MUC1 vaccine response may lead to more effective vaccines tailored to individuals with high risk for cancer but with varying immune fitness.","Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a pivotal component of the tumor microenvironment, significantly contributing to the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Direct co-culture of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one of the origins of CAFs, with ESCC cell line, led to increased amphiregulin (AREG) expression and secretion in the ESCC cells. Consequently, the expression and phosphorylation of the AREG receptor EGFR were upregulated in co-cultured ESCC cells. Moreover, AREG treatment enhanced ESCC cell survival and migration through the EGFR-Erk/p38 signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis of AREG using human ESCC tissues showed a positive correlation between the intensity of AREG expression in tumor invasive front and the expression level of the CAF marker FAP. Furthermore, bioinformatics database analysis confirmed a significant upregulation of AREG expression in ESCC tissues compared to normal tissues. These findings suggest that AREG is involved in CAF-mediated ESCC progression and could be a novel therapeutic target for ESCC.","The epigenome is a target for environmental exposures, and a potential determinant of inter-individual differences in response.  In genetically identical C57Bl/6 mice exposed from gestation to weaning to the endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) tributyltin (TBT), tumor development later in life varied across multiple cohorts over time and depending on sex and diet.  In one cohort where approximately half of TBT-exposed male mice developed tumors at 10 months (Katz, 2020), transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and epigenomic (ChIP-seq) profiling was performed on blood and liver tissue from mice that developed tumors (i.e. “high-risk”) and equivalently exposed mice did not (i.e “low-risk”).  Blood transcriptomic signatures separated TBT-exposed from vehicle controls but did not discriminate between animals that developed tumors vs those that did not.  However, uninvolved liver tissue of mice with tumors exhibited transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures distinct from liver tissue of mice without tumors and had many features in common with tumors.  These high-risk transcriptomic and epigenomic features were also found in 10/26 TBT-exposed mice at 5 months, indicating that this risk signature preceded tumor development.  Thus, while early life exposure to TBT exhibits variable penetrance for tumor development, indicating TBT-exposure is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, increased risk for tumor development is linked to epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming of the liver induced by this EDC.","The epigenome is a target for environmental exposures, and a potential determinant of inter-individual differences in response.

A crucial factor for modulating the 60S ribosomal subunits is eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6. Release of eIF6 from 60S is essential to permit 60S interactions with 40S. Here, using the N106S mutant of eIF6, we show that disrupting eIF6 interaction with 60S leads to an increase in vacant 80S. It further highlights a dichotomy in the anti-association activity of eIF6 that is distinct from its role in 60S biogenesis and shows that the nucleolar localization of eIF6 is not dependent on uL14-BCCIP interactions. Limiting active ribosomal pools markedly deregulates translation especially in mitosis and leads to chromosome segregation defects, mitotic exit delays and mitotic catastrophe. Ribo-Seq analysis of the eIF6-N106S mutant shows a significant downregulation in the translation efficiencies of mitotic factors and specifically transcripts with long 3′UTRs. eIF6-N106S mutation also limits cancer invasion, and this role is correlated with the overexpression of eIF6 only in high-grade invasive cancers suggesting that deregulation of eIF6 is probably not an early event in cancers. Thus, this study highlights the segregation of eIF6 functions and its role in moderating 80S availability for mitotic translation and cancer progression.","Moderating the pool of active ribosomal subunits is critical for maintaining global translation rates.

Cell states are defined by their epigenetic landscape and have cell state-specific metabolic demands. Defining the regulatory factors involved in the interplay between metabolism and cell state would represent a significant step forward in understanding the genetic circuitry that drives differentiation of progenitor cells into highly specialized cell types for proper tissue formation. Expression levels of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) mega-cluster have been shown to correlate with distinct metabolic profiles in a variety of progenitor cells, suggesting it functions as a key regulator of metabolism and cell state. Here, we directly demonstrate that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a central player coordinating mitochondrial metabolic activity and genome-wide epigenetic changes in myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Stable muscle cell lines were generated harboring two distinct deletions in the proximal promoter region resulting in either greatly upregulated or severely attenuated transcription of the entire mega-cluster of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. Both mutant lines displayed impaired myotube formation along with perturbed mitochondrial respiration and widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and histone methylation. Global gene expression patterns and pathway analyses indicated a reprogramming of cell state which created a differentiated-like molecular profile in proliferating myoblasts. Our results strongly suggest that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a nodal regulator coordinating metabolic activity and the epigenome to maintain proper cell state in the myogenic lineage.","Background: Fibrosis, defined by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including type I collagen, results in a stiff scar tissue that impairs organ function and can cause death. The effector cells of fibrosis are myofibroblasts, an activated form of fibroblast. In gingiva (gums), fibrotic responses are predominantly hyperproliferative (hyperplasia), where transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is overexpressed, and via canonical signaling pathway acts on gingival fibroblasts to induce fibroproliferative genes such as cellular communications network factor 2 (CCN2). Targeting of TGFβ for therapeutic gain however is challenging due its pleotropic nature, and therefore identifying new and targetable alternatives is warranted. We have shown that mechanical tension as a result of stiff ECM increases TGFβ-driven expression of CCN2 in gingival fibroblasts. We further identified yes-activated protein (YAP1), a mechanosensitive transcription (co)factor that translocate to nucleus in response to mechanical tension in gingival fibroblasts. To test if YAP is the perpetuator of TGFβ-mediated fibroproliferative gene induction, I used celastrol, a recently identified YAP/TAZ (transcriptional co-activator PDZ-binding motif) inhibitor, whose anti-fibrotic potential is not yet elucidated -- projecting it as a potential treatment option for gingival hyperplasia.  Methods: Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) in culture were serum starved overnight and pretreated with 500nM Celastrol or DMSO for 45 minutes followed by stimulation with or without TGFβ1 for 6 hours (RT-PCR) and 24 hours (Western blot). mRNA samples collected at 6 hours were also analysed using BulkRNAsequencing and functional cluster analysis. Celastrol’s capacity to prevent the TGFβ induced proliferation of HGFs was investigated with BrdU cell proliferation assay. Celastrol’s ability to block TGFβ-mediated YAP nuclear localization in HGFs was assessed using immunofluorescent staining of YAP protein.  Results: In response to added TGFβ1, the gene and protein expression of fibrotic marker and mediator CCN2 (a known YAP1 target) was significantly downregulated in the presence of Celastrol. Similarly, of the 1364 genes induced by TGFβ1 (&gt;2-fold), 657 genes showed a &gt;50% decrease in the presence of Celastrol including genes involved in fibrotic responses such as type 4 collagen, interleukin 11, etc., Functional cluster analysis revealed ECM, Wnt/cytokine signaling, focal adhesion clusters induced by added TGFβ1, were downregulated in a Celastrol sensitive fashion. Also, basal level proliferation of HGFs was repressed in the presence of Celastrol. Additionally, Celastrol also successfully blocked TGFβ-mediated nuclear translocation of YAP as seen with immunofluorescence microscopy.  Conclusion: These results are consistent with our hypothesis that targeting YAP/TAZ may be useful in blocking the profibrotic effects of TGFβ and that celastrol or other YAP inhibitors are eligible candidates as a treatment option for gingival hyperplasia.","To investigate SLC7A11 inhibition-induced ferroptosis in LDHB-deficient lung cancer cells requires glutaminolysis","Purpose: To date, the biological activity of AMF has not been fully investigated. We set out to analyze how AMF regulates gene expression in HepG2 cells. Conclusions: we performed clustering analysis on the various expressed genes associated with autophagy, and the pathways confirmed in the KEGG and BP analysis","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor whose activation can regulate B cell-mediated immune responses. Given the diverse nature of human B cell subsets, scRNA-seq transcriptomic profiling was used to ascertain the heterogeneity of AHR expression in discrete B cell subpopulations. We identified a unique cell cluster enriched in expression of AHR and CD9. Further, these cells were diminished in their expression of canonical B cell-associated genes and enriched with a myeloid cell-specified gene signature. These results were confirmed in vitro as CD14 expressing B cells were readily detectable in human donor PBMC and expressed significantly more AHR protein. Following activation in vitro, CD9+ B cells secreted IgM, IL-10, TGFβ1, and several myeloid-associated pro-inflammatory mediators, specifically CXCL8. These results demonstrate CD14 expression by B cells is readily detectable in healthy human donors and their release of CXCL8 could implicate these cells in inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity.","PRAME is a prominent member of the cancer germline antigen family of proteins, which triggers autologous T-cell mediated immune responses. Integrative genomic analysis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) uncovered recurrent, and highly focal deletions of 22q11.22 including the PRAME gene, which were associated with poor outcome. PRAME-deleted tumors showed cytotoxic T-cell immune escape and were associated with cold tumor microenvironments. In addition, PRAME down-modulation was strongly associated with somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in DLBCL, and PRC2-regulated genes were repressed in isogenic PRAME KO vs. PRAME wt lymphoma cell lines, with PRAME directly interacting with EZH2 as a negative regulator. EZH2 inhibition with EPZ-6438 abrogated these extrinsic and intrinsic effects leading to PRAME and microenvironment restoration in vivo. Our data highlight multiple functions of PRAME during lymphomagenesis, and provide a preclinical rationale for synergistic therapies combining epigenetic re-programming with PRAME-targeted therapies.","The IL-2 receptor α chain (IL-2Rα/CD25) is constitutively expressed on double-negative (DN2/DN3 thymocytes and regulatory T cells (Tregs) but induced by IL-2 on T and natural killer (NK) cells, with Il2ra expression regulated by a STAT5-dependent super-enhancer. We investigated CD25 regulation and function using a series of mice with deletions spanning STAT5-binding elements. Deleting the upstream super-enhancer region mainly affected constitutive CD25 expression on DN2/DN3 thymocytes and Tregs, with these mice developing autoimmune alopecia, whereas deleting an intronic region decreased IL-2-induced CD25 on peripheral T and NK cells. Thus, distinct super-enhancer elements preferentially control constitutive versus inducible expression in a cell type-specific manner. The mediator-1 coactivator colocalized with specific STAT5-binding sites. Moreover, both upstream and intronic regions had extensive chromatin interactions, and deletion of either region altered the super-enhancer structure in mature T cells. These results demonstrate differential functions for distinct super-enhancer elements, thereby indicating previously unknown ways to manipulate CD25 expression in a cell type-specific fashion.","Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells regulate vascular changes crucial for placental function and fetal growth. The functional capacity of uNK cells is shaped by their education status.  To explore the mechanisms of uNK cell education, we isolated NKG2A+ and Ly49C/I+ educated uNK cells and compared their transcriptomes to uneducated NKG2A-Ly49C/I- uNK cells.","The activation of IP3 receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channels generates agonist-mediated Ca2+ signals that are critical for the regulation of a   wide range of biological processes. It is therefore surprising that CRISPR induced loss of all three IP3R isoforms (TKO) in HEK293 and HeLa cell lines yields cells that can survive, grow and divide, albeit more slowly than wild-type cells. In an effort to understand the adaptive mechanisms involved, we have examined the activity of key Ca2+ dependent transcription factors (NFAT, CREB and AP-1) and signaling pathways using luciferase-reporter assays, phosphoprotein immunoblots and whole genome transcriptomic studies. In addition, the diacylglycerol arm of the signaling pathway was investigated with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and siRNA knockdown. The data showed that agonist-mediated NFAT activation was lost but CREB activation was maintained in IP3R TKO cells. Under base-line conditions transcriptome analysis indicated the differential expression of 828 and 311 genes in IP3R TKO HEK293 or HeLa cells, respectively, with only 18 genes being in common. Three main adaptations in TKO cells were identified in this study: 1) increased basal activity of NFAT, CREB and AP-1; 2) an increased reliance on Ca2+- insensitive PKC isoforms; and 3) increased production of reactive oxygen species and upregulation of antioxidant defense enzymes. We suggest that whereas wild-type cells rely on a Ca2+ and DAG signal to respond to stimuli, the TKO cells utilize the adaptations to allow key signaling pathways (e.g. PKC, Ras/MAPK, CREB) to transition to the activated state using a DAG signal alone.","The first-generation rAAV-ST3GAL5 replacement vector employing a ubiquitous promoter led to hepatic injury and death caused by high off-target ST3GAL5 expression when administered systemically. In contract, a seconed-geneeration vector optimized for CNS-restricted expression of ST3GAL5 eliminated liver toxicity while preserving neurotherapeutic effects.","Keloids are benign fibroproliferative tumours resulting from skin damage such as trauma, burns or surgery. Keloids are more prevalent in populations with darkly pigmented skin. Links between skin pigmentation and vitamin D production have been established and some studies indicate involvement of vitamin D signalling in keloid pathology. This study assessed the impact of paricalcitol (a selective vitamin D signalling activator) on fibroblasts derived from keloid and normal skin, to further investigate the role and potential clinical relevance of vitamin D signalling in keloid pathology. Analysis of keloid and normal skin tissue using immunohistochemistry demonstrated a significant reduction of nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) in keloid tissue. After treatment with paricalcitol, nuclear VDR was increased in both keloid and normal fibroblasts. RNA sequencing of normal fibroblasts treated with paricalcitol demonstrated significant changes in gene expression, with many upregulated genes identified to have anti-fibrotic effects. However, paricalcitol failed to alter gene expression in Keloid fibroblasts. To investigate this further, we performed RNA sequencing of normal and keloid fibroblasts and found that retinoid-X receptor α (RXRα), a key binding partner of VDR required for downstream transcriptional activation, is significantly downregulated in keloid fibroblasts. Our results indicate that paricalcitol can effectively activate VDR translocation to the nucleus but is unable to effect change at the transcriptional level in keloid fibroblasts, most likely due to the reduced expression of RXRα. This suggests Vitamin D signalling may be aberrant in keloids, and that supplementation with Vitamin D alone would likely be ineffective in restoring signalling. Keywords: Keloid, Vitamin D receptor, Paricalcitol, Retinoid-X receptor α","The 5’ end RNA molecules transcribed by RNA polymerase II are known to be modified in human cells. Specifically, A-initiated transcripts can be methylated at both the 2’-O position in the ribose (2’-O-methylation, or cap-1) and the N6-position in the base (N6-methylation). Almost all A-initiated transcripts have the cap-1 modification, however, the N6-methylation is optional. As a result, A-initiated transcripts in the cell can be Am (cap-1 only) or m6Am (cap-1 and N6-methylation) modified. To study m6Am, we developed CROWN-seq, which simultaneously obtains the transcription-start information and the stoichiometry of N6-methyl. With CROWN-seq, we found that the previous m6Am mapping studies highly underestimated the diversity of the transcription-start site (nucleotide) of the transcriptome. In this study, we used CROWN-seq to reveal m6Am sites and stoichiometry among different human cell lines. We demonstrated that m6Am stoichiometry in mRNA is in general high, however, m6Am stoichiometry in snRNA, snoRNA, and their pseudogenes is more variable.","Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a devastating disease characterised by late diagnosis, genetic neoplastic heterogeneity, poor T-cell infiltration, a highly immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, and metastatic spreading which results in poor clinical outcomes. Surgery remains the most effective treatment, although it is limited to a few patients. Local ablative techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have been proposed to control PC progression in patients with nonresectable tumours. However, the impact of these therapies on promoting the activation of the immune system and eliciting an effective anti-tumour immune response remains elusive. Whether local ablative techniques could overcome resistance to immunotherapy in PC is unknown.   We enrolled a cohort of patients with non-resectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer and longitudinally evaluated the impact of local thermal ablation on circulating immunological parameters. Additionally, we used cancer cell lines derived from PC transgenic mouse models to establish a preclinical platform that recapitulates systemic and localised inflammation induced by RFA in vivo. Finally, we employed this preclinical experimental platform to evaluate the efficacy of the therapeutic treatments.   Thermal ablation induced a short-term inflammatory process resulting in a systemic increase in myeloid cells as well as increased plasma levels of high mobility group box 1 molecule, which correlates with a better patient outcome. We performed thermal ablative procedures in mice bearing orthotopic PC and evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of thermal treatment alone or in combination with immune checkpoint-based immunotherapy through activation of a T lymphocyte-dependent anti-tumour immune response. We demonstrated that RFA synergises with immunotherapy to restrict tumour progression, significantly improving the overall survival of PC-bearing mice. Tumour immune landscape characterisation confirmed that RFA in combination with immunotherapy supported the sculpting of an immune hostile milieu towards an effective anti-tumour milieu characterised by an increased infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in spite of CD206-expressing tumour-associated macrophages.   Our study confirmed that RFA enhances immunotherapy effectiveness by breaking tumour immune tolerance and unleashing the full cytotoxic abilities of tumour-specific T-cells. Thus, RFA can circumvent the current limitations of immunotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.","Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a devastating disease characterised by late diagnosis, genetic neoplastic heterogeneity, poor T-cell infiltration, a highly immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, and metastatic spreading which results in poor clinical outcomes.

Here, we developed clinically relevant fully immunocompetent syngeneic models to evaluate the potential for CAR-M to remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME), induce T cell anti-tumor immunity, and sensitize solid tumors to PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibition. In vivo, anti-HER2 CAR-M significantly reduced tumor burden, prolonged survival, remodeled the TME, increased intratumoral T cell and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration, and induced epitope spreading. CAR-M therapy protected against antigen-negative relapse in a T cell dependent fashion, confirming long-term anti-tumor immunity. In HER2+ solid tumors resistant to anti-PD1(aPD1) monotherapy, the combination of CAR-M and aPD1 significantly improved tumor growth control, survival, and remodeling of the TME. These results demonstrate synergy between CAR-M and T cell checkpoint blockade and provide a strategy to enhance response to aPD1 therapy for patients with non-responsive tumors.","RNA-seq analysis was performed in a T-ALL cell line (Jurkat) with FKBP tag knock-in at the MYB locus to analyze gene expression changes after MYB (L)/(S) overexpression in dTAG-mediated MYB-depleted cells.","RNA-seq analysis with spike-in was performed in a T-ALL cell line (Jurkat) with FKBP tag knock-in at the MYB locus to analyze gene expression changes after dTAG-mediated MYB depletion.","RNA-seq analysis was performed in a T-ALL cell line (Jurkat) with FKBP tag knock-in at the MYB locus to analyze gene expression changes after dTAG-mediated MYB depletion.","ATAC-seq analysis was performed in a T-ALL cell line (Jurkat) with FKBP knock-in at MYB locus to analyze chromatin accessibility after dTAG-mediated depletion.","Bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 immune systems protect against foreign DNA. However, immune efficiency is constrained by Cas9 off-target effects and toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9 immunity is regulated by CovR, the major regulator of virulence in Group B Streptococcus, a pathobiont responsible for neonatal invasive infections. We show that CovR binds to and represses a distal promoter of the cas operon, embedding immunity in the virulence regulatory network. Releasing CovR repression enhances immune efficiency against suboptimal spacers, originating from old immune memory or mutations, thereby transiently expanding the sequence space recognized and cleaved by Cas9. Furthermore, CovR inactivation promotes the acquisition of new spacers, enhancing immune memory. CovR-mediated immune regulation is conserved at the species level, with lineage-specific variability in the constitutive cas promoter and Cas9 variants, suggesting different evolutionary trajectories. Overall, we describe a coordinated regulatory mechanism between immunity and virulence that enhances the immune repertoire during acute infection phases.","Sjogren’s Disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive salivary and lacrimal gland dysfunction, inflammation, and destruction, and extra glandular manifestations. The etiology and pathophysiology of SjD are incompletely understood. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for immunological tolerance and although Treg abnormalities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, their role in SjD remains ambiguous.  We here show that Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flFoxp3-Cre (Stim1/Stim2 Foxp3cre) mice develop a SjD-like phenotype, including severe sialadenitis with hyposalivation, lacrimal gland (LG) inflammation with dry eye and corneal damage, increased anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibody levels and interstitial lung disease. At the cellular level, salivary gland inflammation in Stim1/2Foxp3 mice is characterized by infiltration with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which is dominated by a T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 immune response. The changes in gene expression in SGs of mice correlate strongly with transcriptional and epigenetic dysregulation found in SjD patients. Our findings in Stim1/Stim2 Foxp3cre mice provide new evidence for a critical role of Treg cells and IFNγ producing Th1 cells in mediating SjD progression.","Histone deacetylases are key epigenetic regulators that control T cell-mediated immunity. A T cell-specific deletion of Hdac1 (HDAC1cKO) protects mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it remains elusive whether inhibition of HDAC1 enzymatic activity and thus mimicking HDAC1 inhibitor treatment is sufficient to block EAE induction. In order to address this question, we generated a novel mouse strain that expresses catalytically inactive HDAC1 (HDAC1Off) from the Rosa26 locus in HDAC1cKO CD4+ T cells to mimic selective inhibition of HDAC1 enzymatic activity in vivo. Mice expressing wildtype HDAC1 in HDAC1cKO CD4+ T cells (HDAC1On) were generated as corresponding controls. In contrast to HDAC1On mice, HDAC1Off mice did not develop EAE, and this correlated with diminished leukocyte CNS infiltration. HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells in the CNS displayed a severe reduction of IFNγ, IL-17A and TNFα proinflammatory cytokine expression. In vivo activated HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells downregulated gene sets associated with T cell activation, inflammatory response and cell migration, indicating impaired effector functions of HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells. Thus, our study demonstrates that the inhibition of the catalytic activity of HDAC1 is sufficient to achieve a clinical benefit in EAE disease development. This raises the exciting translational perspective that targeting HDAC1 enzymatic activity is a promising therapeutic strategy in treating human T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.","Patients aged 65 years and older account for an increasing proportion of those who suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI). Aged TBI patients experience increased morbidity and mortality compared to young TBI patients. Our prior data demonstrated that anti-CD49d antibody (aCD49d Ab), an FDA-approved drug that blocks α4 integrin, abrogates infiltration of CD8+ T-cells into the injured brain, improves survival, and attenuates neurocognitive deficits. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of aCD49d Ab remained unexplored. Here, we aimed to uncover how aCD49d Ab treatment alters local cellular responses in the aged mouse brain. Consequently, we found that mice incur age-associated toxic cytokine and chemokine responses long-term post-TBI. aCD49d Ab attenuates this response along with a T helper (Th)1/Th17 immunological shift and remediation of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. Further, aCD49d Ab further produces a neuroprotective Th2 response and restores age-associated CD8+ T cell senescence. Our results demonstrate that targeting infiltrating CD8+ T cells with aCD49d Ab is a promising therapeutic strategy for treating TBI in aged individuals.","The complex life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and the accompanying transcriptional variation is only explained in part by stage-specific transcription factors like the ApiAP2 family, as these factors are strongly under-represented in Pf. Global and local changes in chromatin structure during life cycle progression suggest the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms as a critical mechanism for fine-tuning gene regulation during malaria parasite development. Pf chromatin is largely unexplored and is distinct from other eukaryotes in many respects. This is likely to accommodate the highly A/T-rich genome which averages over 90% in non-coding regions, the highest of any known eukaryote. We characterized PF3D7_1104200 (PfSnf2L), an ATPase-containing protein that is related to ISWI-type chromatin remodeling enzymes (CREs). Using a conditional knockout (KO) system, we demonstrate that PfSnf2L is essential for parasite development, globally controls just-in-time transcription regulation, and specifically represses gametocyte-specific gene expression. Characterization of the enzymatic activity in vitro, combined with mapping chromatin organization in vivo revealed that PfSnf2L shapes the promotor architecture of stage-specific genes through its nucleosome remodeling activity, thereby influencing gene activation and repression. The unique properties of the Plasmodium Snf2L allowed screening and identification of a specific inhibitor that specifically kills the parasite, phenocopies the loss of correct gene expression timing, and inhibits the formation of gametocytes.","The complex life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and the accompanying transcriptional variation is only explained in part by stage-specific transcription factors like the ApiAP2 family, as these factors are strongly under-represented in Pf.

Although peripheral CD4+ T cells can acquire alternative epigenetic states in response to different cues, it remains unclear whether peripheral iNKT cells are epigenetically stable or maleable. Repetitive encounters of liver-resident iNKT cells (LiNKTs) with galactosylceramide (aGalCer)/CD1d-coated nanoparticles (NPs) can trigger their differentiation into a LiNKT cell subset (LiNKTR1) expressing a T regulatory type 1 (TR1)-like transcriptional signature. Here we use a broad range of omics tools to dissect the epigenetic underpinnings of the LiNKT-LiNKTR1 transdifferentiation process as compared to those underlying the T-conv-to-T-follicular helper (TFH) and TFH-to-TR1 differentiation pathways. We show that LiNKTR1 cell generation is partially associated with treatment induced hypo-methylation of gene bodies and regulatory elements of upregulated genes, in the absence of significant changes in chromatin exposure, deposition of expression-promoting histone marks, or removal of their repressive counterparts from bivalent regulatory elements. In contrast, the Tconv-TFH differentiation process involves extensive remodeling of the chromatin and the acquisition of a broad repertoire of epigenetic modifications that are then inherited by TFH cell-derived TR1 cell progeny. These results suggest that peripheral tissue-resident iNKT cells, unlike conventional T cells but like TFH cells, are epigenetically stable and that such stability contributes to their phenotypic and functional stability.","Background &amp; Aims: The association between chronic inflammation and gastric carcinogenesis is well established, but it is not clear how immune cells and cytokines regulate this process. We investigated the role of interleukin 27 (IL27) in the development of gastric atrophy, hyperplasia, and metaplasia (preneoplastic lesions associated with inflammation-induced gastric cancer) in mice with autoimmune gastritis. Methods: We performed studies with TxA23 mice (control mice), which express a T-cell receptor against the H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase α chain and develop autoimmune gastritis, and TxA23xEbi3-/- mice, which develop gastritis but do not express IL27. In some experiments, mice were given high-dose tamoxifen to induce parietal cell atrophy and spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM). Recombinant IL27 was administered to mice with mini osmotic pumps. Stomachs were collected and analyzed by histopathology and immunofluorescence; we used flow cytometry to measure IL27 and identify immune cells that secrete IL27 in the gastric mucosa. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on immune cells that infiltrated stomach tissues. Results: We identified IL27-secreting macrophages and dendritic cell in the corpus of mice with chronic gastritis (TxA23 mice). Mice deficient in IL27 developed more severe gastritis, atrophy, and SPEM than control mice. Administration of recombinant IL27 significantly reduced the severity of inflammation, atrophy, and SPEM in mice with gastritis. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that IL27 acted almost exclusively on stomach-infiltrating CD4+ T cells to suppress expression of inflammatory genes.  Conclusions: In studies of mice with autoimmune gastritis, we found that IL27 is an inhibitor of gastritis and SPEM, suppressing CD4+ T-cell–mediated inflammation in the gastric mucosa.","Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is a rare disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, combined immunodeficiency, predisposition to malignancies and high clinical variability. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) profiling may provide information on the pathophysiology of complex rare human diseases as they are involved in numerous biological functions including proliferation, differentiation, and DNA repair. To investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in AT patient samples with the aim of identifying miRNA signatures and correlate these patterns with disease pathogenesis. Twenty AT patients (mean age 17.7 + 9.6 years) were enrolled in the study. Clinical and genetic data were collected. We performed a small RNA-seq analysis in PBMCs and fibroblasts to compare miRNA expression profiles in AT patients and controls, and to identify specific expression signatures for AT. We found 42 differentially expressed (DE)-miRNAs in blood samples and 26 in fibroblasts samples. Three DE-miRNAs, miR-342-3p, miR-30a-5p, and miR-195-5p were validated in further AT samples and their dysregulation was confirmed.We identified for the first time, an AT-associated miRNA signature in blood cells and fibroblast samples obtained from a cohort of AT patients. Several pathways were predicted commonly deregulated, mainly involved in cancer. miRNAs may provide information on AT pathophysiology and tumorigenesis.","Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is a rare disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, combined immunodeficiency, a predisposition to malignancies and high clinical variability.

To investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in samples from AT patients with the aim of identifying miRNA patterns and to investigate how these patterns are related to the disease. We performed short a small RNA-seq analysis on fibroblasts to compare the miRNA expression profile between AT patients and controls. We identified, an AT-related miRNA signature in blood cells and fibroblast samples collected from a group of AT patients. We also predicted several dysregulated pathways, primarily related to cancer, immune system control or inflammatory processes. The findings suggest that miRNAs may provide insights into the pathophysiology and tumorigenesis of AT and have the potential to serve as useful biomarkers in cancer research.","The tongue facilitates vital activities such as swallowing. Swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) are common in the elderly and in many adult-onset neuromuscular diseases. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), dysphagia is often the first symptom. OPMD is an autosomal dominant myopathy caused by a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the gene encoding PABPN1. The expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble nuclear aggregates that reduce the levels of the soluble form. Clinical tongue involvement in OPMD has been documented but is poorly understood. Tongue histopathology was investigated in OPMD mouse models using light and electron microscopy. Muscle histopathology was predominantly affected by age. PABPN1 nuclear aggregates were found at moderate levels, whereas deposition of insoluble PABPN1 in blood vessels was already prominent in 4-month-old mice. RNA signatures of the OPMD tongue were enriched for mitochondrial and cytoskeletal genes, suggesting an energy and contractile deficit.  ","PRAME is a prominent member of the cancer germline antigen family of proteins, which triggers autologous T-cell mediated immune responses. Integrative genomic analysis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) uncovered recurrent, and highly focal deletions of 22q11.22 including the PRAME gene, which were associated with poor outcome. PRAME-deleted tumors showed cytotoxic T-cell immune escape and were associated with cold tumor microenvironments. In addition, PRAME down-modulation was strongly associated with somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in DLBCL, and PRC2-regulated genes were repressed in isogenic PRAME KO vs. PRAME wt lymphoma cell lines, with PRAME directly interacting with EZH2 as a negative regulator. EZH2 inhibition with EPZ-6438 abrogated these extrinsic and intrinsic effects leading to PRAME and microenvironment restoration in vivo. Our data highlight multiple functions of PRAME during lymphomagenesis, and provide a preclinical rationale for synergistic therapies combining epigenetic re-programming with PRAME-targeted therapies.","Astrocytes promote neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) through cell-intrinsic activities, and also via their ability to recruit and activate other cell types. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide CRISPR-based forward genetic screen investigating regulators of astrocyte proinflammatory responses, which identified CLEC16A, a gene linked to MS susceptibility, as a suppressor of NF-B signaling. Gene and small molecule perturbation studies in mouse primary and human embryonic stem cell-derived astrocytes in combination with multi-omic analyses established that CLEC16A promotes mitophagy, limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and the accumulation of mitochondrial products that activate NF-κB, the NLRP3 inflammasome and gasdermin D. Astrocytespecific Clec16a inactivation increased NF-κB, NLRP3 and gasdermin D activation in vivo, worsening experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS. Moreover, we detected disrupted mitophagic capacity and gasdermin D activation in astrocytes in samples from individuals with MS. These findings identify CLEC16A as a suppressor of astrocyte pathologic responses and a candidate therapeutic target in MS.","The ovary is one of the first organs to exhibit signs of aging, characterized by reduced tissue function, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis. Multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs), formed by macrophage fusion, typically occur in chronic immune pathologies, including infectious and non-infectious granulomas and the foreign body response, but are also observed in the aging ovary. The function and consequence of ovarian MNGCs remain unknown as their biological activity is highly context-dependent, and their large size has limited their isolation and analysis through technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing. In this study, we define ovarian MNGCs through a deep analysis of their presence across age and species using advanced imaging technologies as well as their unique transcriptome using laser capture microdissection. MNGCs form complex interconnected networks that increase with age in both mouse and nonhuman primate ovaries. MNGCs are characterized by high Gpnmb expression, a putative marker of ovarian and non-ovarian MNGCs. Pathway analysis highlighted functions in apoptotic cell clearance, lipid metabolism, proteolysis, immune processes, and increased oxidative phosphorylation and antioxidant activity. Thus, MNGCs have signatures related to degradative processes, immune function, and high metabolic activity. These processes were enriched in MNGCs compared to primary ovarian macrophages, suggesting discrete functionality. MNGCs express CD4 and colocalize with T-cells, which were enriched in regions of MNGCs, indicative of a close interaction between these immune cell types. These findings implicate MNGCs in modulation of the ovarian immune landscape during aging given their high penetrance and unique molecular signature that supports degradative and immune functions.","Keloids are benign fibroproliferative tumours resulting from skin damage such as trauma, burns or surgery. Keloids are more prevalent in populations with darkly pigmented skin. Links between skin pigmentation and vitamin D production have been established and some studies indicate involvement of vitamin D signalling in keloid pathology. This study assessed the impact of paricalcitol (a selective vitamin D signalling activator) on fibroblasts derived from keloid and normal skin, to further investigate the role and potential clinical relevance of vitamin D signalling in keloid pathology. Analysis of keloid and normal skin tissue using immunohistochemistry demonstrated a significant reduction of nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) in keloid tissue. After treatment with paricalcitol, nuclear VDR was increased in both keloid and normal fibroblasts. RNA sequencing of normal fibroblasts treated with paricalcitol demonstrated significant changes in gene expression, with many upregulated genes identified to have anti-fibrotic effects. However, paricalcitol failed to alter gene expression in Keloid fibroblasts. To investigate this further, we performed RNA sequencing of normal and keloid fibroblasts and found that retinoid-X receptor α (RXRα), a key binding partner of VDR required for downstream transcriptional activation, is significantly downregulated in keloid fibroblasts. Our results indicate that paricalcitol can effectively activate VDR translocation to the nucleus but is unable to effect change at the transcriptional level in keloid fibroblasts, most likely due to the reduced expression of RXRα. This suggests Vitamin D signalling may be aberrant in keloids, and that supplementation with Vitamin D alone would likely be ineffective in restoring signalling. Keywords: Keloid, Vitamin D receptor, Paricalcitol, Retinoid-X receptor α","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide1,2. HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulated progressive driver mutations3, with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin2. However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is independent of the underlying aetiologies4.  Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations5,6. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC7. We generated over twenty-five new genetically-driven in vivo and in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance, and metastasis to distant organs. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human-mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with histopathology.  In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard of care treatment and used a linked in vitro-in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not been linked to HCC treatment before. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard of care therapy.","Climate change is impacting human health through a historic rise in wildfire smoke across the United States and the world. Whereas the deleterious effects of wildfire smoke and associated air pollution on asthma outcomes are well-established epidemiologically, genetic risks and molecular mechanisms of how wildfire smoke affects asthma are unknown. This knowledge gap hinders the identification of high-risk individuals and the creation of targeted therapies or recommendations to protect these individuals. Here, we employ a genetic approach to identify common variant (minor allele frequency &gt; 0.05) exposure-conditional genetic risk variants that localize with genomic responses to wood smoke particles (WSP), a model of wildfire smoke exposure, and associate with asthma in the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort. Our novel approach used nascent transcriptional signatures derived from WSP-exposed Beas-2B airway epithelial cells to reduce the genome sequence for discovery and allow a permutation-based statistical approach to identify 52 candidate SNPs. We applied biologic and bioinformatic filters to prioritize variants for direct testing of allele-dependent transcriptional regulatory function in plasmid reporters. The rs3861144 variant identified by this approach controls WSP responses of airway epithelial cells to SPRY2, which we showed is involved in mechanical injury repair in cell culture. Our results demonstrate that wildfire particulates contribute to asthma risk at the molecular level, and we have identified mechanistic targets and genetic variant candidates to apply for clinical risk prediction and development of targeted therapies for high-risk individuals.","Lung ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common clinical pathology associated with high mortality. The pathophysiology of lung I/R injury involves ferroptosis and elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, while the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on lung I/R injury remains unclear. This research aimed to explore the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on reducing ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells caused by I/R.  First, we identified O-GlcNAc transferase 1 (Ogt1) as a differentially expressed gene in lung epithelial cells of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) patients, using single-cell sequencing, and Gene Ontology analysis (GO analysis) revealed the enrichment of the ferroptosis process. We found a time-dependent dynamic alteration in lung O-GlcNAcylation during I/R injury. Proteomics analysis identified the differentially expressed proteins enriched in ferroptosis and multiple redox-related pathways based on KEGG annotation. Thus, we generated Ogt1-conditional knockout mice and found that Ogt1 deficiency aggravated ferroptosis, as evidenced by lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), Fe2+, as well as alterations in critical protein expression glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Consistently, we found that elevated O-GlcNAcylation inhibited ferroptosis sensitivity in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury-induced TC-1 cells via O-GlcNAcylated NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, both the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that Nrf2 could bind with translation start site (TSS) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and promote its transcriptional activity. As an important rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), elevated G6PDH provided a mass of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to improve the redox state of glutathione (GSH) and eventually led to ferroptosis resistance. Rescue experiments proved that Nrf2 knockdown or Nrf2-T334A (O-GlcNAcylation site) mutation abolished the protective effect of ferroptosis resistance.  In summary, we revealed that O-GlcNAcylation could protect against I/R lung injury by reducing ferroptosis sensitivity via the Nrf2/G6PDH pathway. Our work will provide a new basis for clinical therapeutic strategies for pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute lung injury.","Visceral adiposity is more related with insulin resistance than BMI itself. To study the molecular signature of the subsequent evolution steps of the metabolic sequalae of obesity we collected omental adipose tissue samples from individuals with obesity while undergoing bariatric surgery. Participants (all with obesity) were divided in 4 groups according to glycemic profile: Insulin sensitive/normoglycemic group (IS NG) - OxHOMA2&lt;1 and fasting glycemia &lt; 100 mg/dL (n=17); Insulin resistant/normoglycemic group (IR NG) - OxHOMA2 &gt; 1 and fasting glycemia &lt; 100 mg/dL and HbA1c &lt; 5.7% (n=24); Pre diabetes group (PD) - OxHOMA2 &gt; 1 and fasting glycemia &gt; 100 mg/dL or HbA1c [5.7% - 6.4%] (n=33); Type 2 diabetes group (T2D) - OxHOMA2 &gt; 1 and fasting glycemia &gt; 125 mg/dL or HbA1c &gt; 6.4% (n=18). A panel of 43 genes related to inflammation, angiogenesis, lipid metabolism and redox machinery was evaluated in a BioMark HD Fluidigm system.","Objectives: Glycine acts in an autocrine positive feedback loop in human β cells through its ionotropic receptors (GlyRs). In type 2 diabetes (T2D), islet GlyR activity is impaired by unknown mechanisms. We sought to investigate if the GlyR dysfunction in T2D is replicated by hyperglycemia per se, and to further characterize its action in β cells and the islets.   Methods: GlyR-mediated currents were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp in human β cells from donors with or without T2D, or after high glucose culture. We also correlated glycine-induced current amplitude with transcript expression levels through patch-seq. The expression of the GlyR α1, α3, and β subunit mRNA splice variants was compared between islets from donors with and without T2D, and after high glucose culture. Insulin secretion from human islets was measured in the presence or absence of the GlyR antagonist strychnine.  Results: Gene expression of GlyRs was decreased in islets from T2D donors along with smaller GlyR-mediated currents in the β cells. Glycine-induced currents are also reduced in islets from donors without diabetes after 48 hours of culture in high glucose, along with reducedα1 subunit expression and increased  α3 subunit expression. Glycine-evoked currents are highly heterogeneous between different β cells within and between donors; inversely correlated with donor HbA1c; and significantly correlated to the expression of 99 different transcripts. Finally, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is decreased in the presence of strychnine.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide.

Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC. We generated over twenty-five new genetically-driven in vivo and in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance, and metastasis to distant organs. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human-mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard of care treatment and used a linked in vitro-in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not been linked to HCC treatment before. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard of care therapy.","Following DNA replication, the newly reassembled chromatin is disorganized and must mature to its steady state to maintain both genome and epigenome integrity. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this critical process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac), a mark on newly-synthesized H3, facilitates the remodeling of disorganized nucleosomes in nascent chromatin, and its removal at the subsequent G2/M phase of the cell cycle marks the completion of chromatin maturation. In vitro, H3K56ac enhances the activity of ISWI chromatin remodelers, including yeast ISW1 and its human equivalent SNF2h. In vivo, a deficiency of H3K56ac in nascent chromatin results in the formation of closely packed di-nucleosomes and/or tetra-nucleosomes. In contrast, abnormally high H3K56ac levels disrupt chromatin maturation, leading to genome instability. These findings establish a central role of H3K56ac in chromatin maturation and reveal a mechanism regulating this critical aspect of chromosome replication.","This study examines the actions of the agricultural fungicide vinclozolin on the F0 generation, followed by jet fuel hydrocarbon mixture exposure of the F1 generation, and then pesticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on the F2 generation gestating females. The subsequent F3 and F4 generations and F5 transgenerational-generation were examined for male sperm epigenetic alterations and pathology in males and females. Significant impacts on the male sperm differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) were observed. The F3-F5 generations were similar in approximately 50% of the DMRs. The pathology of each generation was assessed in the testis, ovary, kidney, prostate, obesity, and tumors. The pathology used a newly developed Deep Learning (DL), artificial intelligence (AI), based histopathology analysis. Observations demonstrated compounded disease impacts in obesity and metabolic parameters, but other pathologies plateaued with smaller increases at the F5 transgenerational generation. Therefore, the multiple generational exposures, which occurs in human populations, may increase epigenetic impacts and disease susceptibility.","Studying the functional consequences of structural variants (SVs) in mammalian genomes is challenging because: 1) SVs arise much less commonly than single nucleotide variants or small indels; and 2) methods to generate, map and characterize SVs in model systems are underdeveloped. To address these challenges, we developed Genome-Shuffle-seq, a method that enables the multiplex generation and mapping of thousands of SVs (deletions, inversions, translocations, extrachromosomal circles) throughout mammalian genomes. We also demonstrate the co-capture of SV identity with single-cell transcriptomes, facilitating the measurement of SVs’ impact on gene expression. We anticipate Genome-Shuffle-seq will be broadly useful for the systematic exploration of the functional consequences of SVs on gene expression, chromatin landscape, and 3D nuclear architecture, while also initiating a path towards a minimal mammalian genome.","Studying the functional consequences of structural variants (SVs) in mammalian genomes is challenging because: 1) SVs arise much less commonly than single nucleotide variants or small indels; and 2) methods to generate, map and characterize SVs in model systems are underdeveloped.

Using digital pathology in human and mouse tissues, we define 3 matrix regions: the tumour body (TB), the proximal invasive front (PIF)- and a further distal invasive front (DIF) Increased matrix density coupled to larger fibre thickness, length and alignment are all features of both invasive areas. Importantly, radial fibre orientation is a characteristic of the distal invasive front. Using several in vivo and in vitro 3-dimensional (3D) models, we show that matrix density and alignment induces RhoA/C-ROCK-Myosin activity in cancer cells, while maximal amoeboid directed migration correlates with areas of radial fibre orientation. Importantly, matrix topographical features are enough to prime cancer cells for successful local invasion and metastatic colonisation. Using several spatial OMICs, we describe a mechano-inflammatory transcriptional program linked to matrix topographical features in the invasive fronts of primary tumours that is preserved in metastatic lesions and strongly linked to worse prognosis in patients.","The pulmonary response to inhalation exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and fracking sand particles (FSD) was investigated in a rat model.  Healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed by whole-body inhalation to air (control) or an aerosol containing DEP at a concentration of 1.0 mg/m3 combined with FSD at concentrations of 30 mg/m3, 6 hours/day for 4 days.  The control and DEP/FSD exposed rats were euthanized at post-exposure time intervals of 1, 7, or 27 days and pulmonary inflammatory, cytotoxic, and oxidant responses were determined.  Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage parameters of toxicity such as lactate dehydrogenase activity, oxidant generation, and inflammation revealed only minimal changes in pulmonary toxicity in the DEP/FSD-exposed rats, compared with the time-matched controls. The lung gene expression profiles showed only minimal changes in the DEP/FSD exposed rats compared with the controls. Specifically, there were a total of 6 genes significantly differentially expressed (fold change &gt;1.5 and FDR p&lt;0.05) only at the one-day post-exposure group. The data obtained from the present study demonstrated that DEP/FSD inhalation exposure, under the conditions employed in the present study, resulted in only minimal changes in lung toxicity and gene expression profile in the rats.","Tissues throughout the human body exert finely-tuned specific functions even when there is considerable overlap in the cellular constituents. Even when the major cellular component of tissues is the same – for example in the case of smooth muscle-rich tissues - discrete phenotypes are evident.  Yet, the molecular expression profiles underpinning such specialised functionality is often unclear.  This presents a challenge for introducing new medicinal therapies for pathophysiologies: can one target what makes tissue functionality unique without producing unwanted effects on the features that are similar. Such a scenario can be considered for the human uteroplacental unit.  Ideally, one would like to target complications of pregnancy like pre-eclampsia (hypertension and proteinuria) or spontaneous preterm birth (early activation of parturition) by targeting particular types of smooth muscle tissues (e.g. arteries versus myometrium) without adversely affecting others.  This situation is further complicated by the need to consider maternal and fetoplacental circumstances.  Three smooth muscle-rich tissues of importance here are myometrium, maternal uterine (myometrial) arteries and placental arteries.  Indeed, each display subtly distinct phenotypes suggesting that distinct molecular signatures may underlie these differences. Hence, we aimed to compare expression profiles of these three tissues to identify the underpinning molecular signatures using multi-omics approaches.","A mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation defect leads to dysregulation of plasma long-chain acyl carnitines, dysregulation of plasma amino acids, and an increased reliance on glucocorticoid signaling to maintain euglycemia during fasting. [muscle] Skeletal muscle tissue relies on products of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) during conditions of metabolic stress: fasting, prolonged exercise, febrile illness. Fasting-induced hypoglycemia and rhabdomyolysis are characteristic features of FAO disorders including very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency (VLCADD). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the connection between FAO dysfunction and skeletal muscle dysfunction are not known. Here, we investigated the  transcriptional response in skeletal muscle tissue (gastrocnemius) to the FAO defect in a model of VLCADD: the long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) knockout (KO) mouse. We found that differentially expressed genes in the muscle were associated with molecular networks annotated for the cellular response to starvation from population-based models. To validate the association between the starvation response and FAO, we pharmacologically inhibited both glucocorticoid signaling and FAO in a model of fasting and observed that mice depleted in both pathways lost less weight during fasting and became hypoglycemic. These findings implicate glucocorticoid signaling as a candidate modifier of the cellular response to starvation in muscle tissue in the context of FAO disorders including VLCADD.","full title: A mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation defect in a mouse model leads to dysregulation of plasma long-chain acylcarnitines, dysregulation of plasma amino acids, and an increased reliance on glucocorticoid signaling to maintain euglycemia during fasting. [liver] The liver is a major source of energy substrates during metabolic stress: fasting, prolonged exercise, febrile illness. Fasting-induced hypoglycemia is a characteristic feature of FAO disorders including very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency (VLCADD). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the diversity of clinical presentation of FAO dysfunction are not known. Here, we investigated the transcriptional response in liver tissue to the FAO defect in a model of VLCADD: the long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) knockout (KO) mouse. We found that differentially expressed genes from the liver were associated with molecular networks annotated for fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol biosynthesis from population-based networks.","The ultimate goal of immunometabolism is to modulate metabolic pathways to enhance immunity. Here, we investigate the potential of an alternative oxidase (AOX) to counteract cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency in T cells. COX is vital for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and its deficiency leads to redox imbalances, impaired metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis, resulting in T cell immunodeficiency. We introduced an AOX into COX-deficient T cells, which revealed a normalization of genes involved in redox balance, apoptosis, and metabolic pathways. Mitochondrial function, glycolysis and TCA cycle function were also restored. AOX-enhanced T cells showed improved activation, proliferation, differentiation, and memory formation, resulting in better immune responses against viral challenges. These findings suggest that targeting the ubiquinol pool could be a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing T cell function in conditions characterized by COX dysfunction and compromised immune responses.","Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) fuels cellular ATP demands. OXPHOS defects lead to severe human disorders with unexplained tissue specific pathologies. Mitochondrial gene expression is essential for OXPHOS biogenesis since core subunits of the complexes are mitochondrial-encoded. COX14 is required for translation of COX1, the central mitochondrial-encoded subunit of complex IV. Here we describe a COX14 mutant mouse corresponding to a patient with complex IV deficiency. COX14M19I mice display broad tissue-specific pathologies. A hallmark phenotype is severe liver inflammation linked to release of mitochondrial RNA into the cytosol sensed by RIG-1 pathway. We find that mitochondrial RNA release is triggered by increased reactive oxygen species production in the deficiency of complex IV. Additionally, we describe a COA3Y72C mouse, affected in an assembly factor that cooperates with COX14 in early COX1 biogenesis, which displays a similar yet milder inflammatory phenotype. Our study provides insight into a link between defective mitochondrial gene expression and tissue-specific inflammation.","To investigate the role of LRPPRC and mutant LRPPRC on the stability of the mitochondrially encoded mRNA transcripts.","Mitochondrial energy metabolism and function are key processes underlying the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and predisposition to type 2 diabetes. This is because mitochondria produce most of the energy required by the cell. Impaired energy production, use of energy stores and mitochondrial dysfunction are major features in metabolic diseases. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how mitochondrial dysfunction can cause, contribute to, or result in insulin resistance and metabolic diseases. Furthermore there is growing evidence from genetic and genome wide-association studies that genetic variation in mtDNA contributes to these common metabolic diseases (Wallace, 2005), however there has been essentially no in vivo functional validation for these findings. Therefore we generated a mouse model homozygous for a polymorphism in the Mrpp3 gene identified in the French Canadian population responsible for 22% of mitochondrial epitranscriptome variation, with likely consequences on metabolism. We investigated the in vivo effects of the polymorphism on mitochondrial function and metabolism in mice fed normal and high fat diet. We identify that the polymorphism reduces the efficiency of mitochondrial RNA processing and this is most pronounced in the pancreas that results in insulin resistance. The MRPP3 protein containing the Asn434Ser polymorphism associates specifically with the calcium antiporter LETM1 preventing effective release of calcium from mitochondria and consequently impairs insulin release from the pancreatic islet cells of these mice. Reduction in insulin secretion and enlarged pancreatic islet size results in lower circulating levels of insulin that causes insulin resistance and liver steatosis. Our findings reveal for the first time the link between mitochondrial gene regulation and insulin resistance via calcium signaling.","Mitochondrial energy metabolism and function are key processes underlying the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and predisposition to type 2 diabetes.

We aimed to discover early events associated to ovarian carcinogenesis, which could represent putative targets for preventive strategies of this silent killer tumor. We identified the first molecular signature associated with French Canadian BRCA1 or BRCA2  founder mutations in morphologically normal ovarian epithelial cells. We discovered that wild-type and mutated BRCA2 allelic transcripts were expressed not only in morphologically normal but also in tumor cells from 8765delAG BRCA2 carriers.  Further analysis of morphologically normal ovarian and tumor cells from C4446T BRCA1 carriers lead to the same observation. Our data support the idea that one single hit in BRCA1 or BRCA2 is sufficient to alter the transcriptome of phenotypically normal ovarian epithelial cell. The highest level of BRCA2 mutated allele transcript expression was measured in cells originating from the most aggressive ovarian tumor. The penetrance of the mutation and the aggressiveness of the related tumor could depend on a dosage effect of the mutated allele transcript.","Upregulation of  CI, CIII and CV  at a protein but not mRNA level in LSCOX cell with COX deficiency due to SURF1 mutations compared to control – evidence for posttranscriptional compensatory mechanism.","Rapid advances in genotyping and sequencing technology have dramatically accelerated the discovery of genes underlying human disease.  Elucidating the function of such genes and understanding their role in pathogenesis, however, remains challenging.  Here, we introduce a genomic strategy to functionally characterize such genes, and apply it to LRPPRC (leucine-rich PPR-motif containing), a poorly studied gene that is mutated in Leigh Syndrome, French Canadian type (LSFC). We utilize RNAi to engineer an allelic series of cellular models in which LRPPRC has been stably silenced to different levels of knockdown efficiency.  Using expression profiling, we discovered a specific role for LRPPRC in the expression of all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded mRNAs, but not the rRNAs, without affecting nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins.","Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally.  Newly metastasising cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours.  There is interest in exploiting this vulnerability to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis.  Here, we show that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, including with aspirin, enhances immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelet TXA2 triggers an immunosuppressive pathway within T cells dependent upon the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor (TCR)-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases.  Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or through platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner dependent upon T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo.  These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway limiting T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing a mechanistic basis for the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.","The ultimate goal of immunometabolism is to modulate metabolic pathways to enhance immunity.

Leigh syndrome (LS) is the most common pediatric MD and is characterized by progressive neuromuscular affectation and premature death. Here, we show that daily cannabidiol (CBD) administration significantly extends lifespan and ameliorates pathology in two LS mouse models, and cellular function in fibroblast from LS patients. CBD delays motor decline and neurodegenerative signs, improves social deficits and breathing abnormalities, decreases thermally induced seizures, and improves neuropathology in affected brain regions. Mechanistically, we identify peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) as a key contributor to CBD’s beneficial effects, and provide proof of dysregulated PPARg expression and activity as a common feature in both mouse neurons and fibroblasts from LS patients. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for CBD as a potential treatment for LS.","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification in mammalian cells, mediated co-transcriptionally by a methyltransferase ‘writer’ complex containing METTL3 as the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding subunit as well as adaptors such WTAP and ZC3H13","Endothelial cells control inflammation in inflammatory and infectious diseases through regulating endothelial gene expression and permeability. Roundabout4 (Robo4) is an endothelial-specific protein that stabilizes endothelial cells. Robo4 has been shown to ameliorate mouse inflammatory and severe infectious diseases, such as sepsis and COVID-19 by reducing vascular permeability. Despite this, it remains uncertain whether these are the only mechanisms by which Robo4 ameliorates the diseases. In this study, we carried out an RNA-seq analysis to investigate the genes regulated by Robo4 in endothelial cells stimulated by TNFα and identified gene, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) , which codes for Cycloocygenase-2 (COX-2). Mechanistic analysis revealed that Robo4 curbs COX-2 expression and endothelial hyperpermeability by preventing prolonged Rac1 activation. Analysis of Robo4 interacting protein identified IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) that maintains active Rac1. Robo4 enhanced ubiquitination of IQGAP1 with a ubiquitin E3 ligase, TNF receptor-associated factor 7 (TRAF7), to inactivate Rac1.  Finally, Robo4 deficiency exacerbates COX-2 -associated inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, edema, and pain in mouse models. Taken together, Robo4 inhibits Rac1 activation by interacting with TRAF7 and IQGAP1, thereby suppressing the endothelial expression of COX-2 and reducing hyperpermeability.  Thus, we uncovered further Robo4 capabilities that suppresses COX-2 and inflammatory diseases, as well as their underlying mechanisms, indicating that endothelial Robo4 is a potential therapeutic target for diverse inflammatory diseases.","The mechanism underlying the loss of normal liver tissues in liver cirrhosis, mainly hepatocytes, is not well-characterized. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death has emerged as a potential mechanism for chronic liver diseases. We have previously demonstrated that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is closely related to the progress of liver cirrhosis. In this study, we aimed to verify whether hepatocytes COX-2 deficiency could protect liver injury via inducing ER stress in liver cirrhosis.","Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) result in increased morbidity and mortality from infections. However, discovering new IEIs is limited by the clinical identification of rare patient cohorts. To predict immunodeficiency-associated genes in a patient-independent approach, we performed a targeted CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen in healthy human donor-derived PBMCs and identified myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) as essential for primary human natural killer (NK) cell functionality ex vivo. MEF2C haploinsufficient (MCHS) patients and mice displayed impaired NK cell development, ex vivo function, and increased susceptibility to viral infection. MEF2C was required for cytokine-induced changes in NK cell metabolism and SREBP-mediated lipid homeostasis, and oleic acid supplementation restored MCHS patient NK cell cytotoxic function. Thus, we demonstrate a CRISPR-based methodology in primary human immune cells to accelerate the identification of new IEIs, and apply this approach to predict and validate a new NK cell immunodeficiency associated with metabolic and functional defects.","Using single-cell RNA-seq of colon lamina propria leukocytes (LPL), together with ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq from colon LPL and sorted CD4+ T from colon lamina propria during oral infection with the pathobiont Helicobacter hepaticus we show that Blimp-1 and c-Maf both positively regulate Il10 gene expression, but also cooperate to negatively regulate a large network of proinflammatory effector genes in T cells. While T cell-specific deletion of either Prdm1, Maf or both transcription factors did not result in overt inflammation of the colon at steady state, H. hepaticus infection resulted in mild/moderate colitis in both the Prdm1fl/flCd4Cre and Maffl/flCd4Cre single T cell-specific transcription factor deficient mice, while the double knockout Prdm1fl/flMaffl/flCd4Cre infected mice suffered severe colitis and showed a massive increase in T cell effector genes in colonic LPL. Blimp-1 and c-Maf cooperate to negatively regulate genes including Ifng, Csf2, Il23r, Stat4, Il18r1 and Il2rg, and deletion of both these transcription factors in T cells translated to an exacerbated pathogenic TH1, IFN-g+GM-CSF+ effector cell response. c-Maf, additionally negatively regulated Il17a expression which was elevated in the LPL as assessed by bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-Seq analysis in the H. hepaticus infected Maffl/flCd4Cre mice.","Using single-cell RNA-seq of colon lamina propria leukocytes (LPL), together with ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq from colon LPL and sorted CD4+ T from colon lamina propria during oral infection with the pathobiont Helicobacter hepaticus we show that Blimp-1 and c-Maf both positively regulate Il10 gene expression, but also cooperate to negatively regulate a large network of proinflammatory effector genes in T cells.

The energy deficiency in AD brain has been at least partially attributed to accelerated mitochondrial dysfunction than normal aging. In earlier publications, we have shown that small molecule mitochondrial complex I inhibitor CP2 facilitated mitochondrial regeneration and rescued mitochondrial deficiency in familial AD mice model APP-PS1. Here in this study, we investigated whether a typical mitochondrial deficiency mouse model could recapitulate molecular expression signatures of AD brain and whether CP2 was able to rescue the AD brain phenotype. Ndufs4 is one of the regulatory subunits of mitochondria complex I. Knockout of Ndufs4 resulted in complex I assembly failure and approximately half mitochondrial function loss. Ndufs4-knockout mice are viable but are short in lifespan (up to about 90 days). This model has been previously used to study Leigh syndrome, a heritable mitochondrial deficiency disease. In this dataset, we performed RNAseq on brains of CP2 treated Ndufs4-knockout mice and examined the expression changes upon CP2 treatment.","A constant communication between mitochondria and nucleus ensures cellular homeostasis and adaptation to mitochondrial stress. Anterograde regulatory pathways involving a large number of nuclear-encoded proteins control mitochondrial biogenesis and functions. Such functions are deregulated in cancer, resulting in proliferative advantages for cancer cells, aggressive disease and therapeutic resistance. Transcriptional networks controlling the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are known, however alternative splicing (AS) regulation has not been implicated in this communication. Here, we show that IQGAP1, a scaffold protein that regulates AS of distinct gene subsets in gastric cancer cells, participates in AS regulation that strongly affects mitochondrial respiration. Combined proteomic and RNA-seq analyses of IQGAP1KO and parental cells show that IQGAP1KO alters a specific AS event of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (CI) subunit NDUFS4 and downregulates a subset of CI subunits. In IQGAP1KO cells, CI intermediates accumulate resembling assembly deficiencies observed in patients with Leigh syndrome bearing NDUFS4 mutations. Mitochondrial CI activity is significantly lower in KO compared to parental cells, while exogenous expression of IQGAP1 reverses mitochondrial defects of IQGAP1KO cells. Our work sheds light to a novel facet of IQGAP1 in mitochondrial quality control that involves fine-tuning of CI activity through AS regulation in gastric cancer.","The arachidonic acid pathway participates in immunosuppression in various types of cancer. Our previous observation detailed that microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase 1 (mPGES-1), an enzyme downstream of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), limited antitumor immunity in melanoma; in addition, genetic depletion of mPGES-1 specifically enhanced immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The present study set out to distinguish the roles of mPGES-1 from those of COX-2 in tumor immunity and determine the potential of mPGES-1 inhibitors for reinforcing immunotherapy in melanoma. Genetic deletion of mPGES-1 showed different profiles of prostaglandin metabolites from that of COX-2 deletion. In our syngeneic mouse model, mPGES-1–deficient cells exhibited similar tumorigenicity to that of COX-2–deficient cells, despite a lower ability to suppress PGE2 synthesis by mPGES-1 depletion, indicating the presence of factors other than PGE2 that are likely to regulate tumor immunity. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that mPGES-1 depletion reduced the expressions of collagen-related genes, which have been found to be associated with immunosuppressive signatures. In our mouse model, collagen was reduced in mPGES-1–deficient tumors, and phenotypic analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes indicated that mPGES-1-deficient tumors had fewer TIM3+ exhausted CD8+ T cells compared with COX-2–deficient tumors. CAY10678, an mPGES-1 inhibitor, was equivalent to celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in reinforcing anti–PD-1 treatment. Our study indicates that mPGES-1 inhibitors represent a promising adjuvant for immunotherapies in melanoma by reducing collagen deposition and T cell exhaustion.","Under homeostatic conditions, NRF2 is repressed by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). Here, we demonstrate that Keap1 deficiency induces Nrf2 activation and post-developmental lethality in zebrafish larvae. Loss of viability is preceded by severe liver abnormalities characterized by an accumulation of lysosomes. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that loss of Keap1 promotes aberrant activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB)/transcription factor binding to IGHM Enhancer 3 (TFE3)-dependent lysosomal biogenesis. Importantly, we find that NRF2-dependent regulation of lysosomal biogenesis is cell autonomous and evolutionarily conserved.","Under homeostatic conditions, NRF2 is repressed by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1).

However, its prolonged clinical therapeutic efficacy is still hindered by serious immune rejection from the host immunological responses to the allogeneic hepatocytes and there is still no an effective approach to generate clinically available autologous hepatocytes for transplantation therapy. Here, we report advanced medium conditions that allow 10,000-fold expansion of primary human hepatocytes from patients suffering inherited liver diseases, providing a new autologous hepatocytes source to this problem. Moreover, we developed a CRISPR–Cas9 genome-targeting system that combines Cas9 ribonucleoproteins and adeno-associated viral vector delivery of a homology-independent large donor (greater than three kilobase) to achieve efficient targeted integration at the AAVS1 safe harbor locus in patient-derived proliferating human hepatocytes (ProliHHs). We further applied this strategy to correct a pathogenic OTC and FAH mutation in ProliHHs and demonstrated improved gene expression, while preserving cell viability for the expansion and purification of edited ProliHHs. Importantly, these edited ProliHHs repopulate into injured mouse liver at a level near to primary human hepatocytes, and they undergo maturation to successfully treat the tyrosinemia mouse model following transplantation in vivo. Thus, this study provides a new autologous hepatocyte therapy techniques that enable large-scale expansion and ex vivo gene correction in patient-derived transplantable ProliHHs, which holds the potential for modeling and treating human liver disease.","Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is a severe genetic disorder that affects the liver due to a defective fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) enzyme in hepatocytes. The drug nitisinone (NTBC) has offered a life-saving treatment for HT1 patients by inhibiting the upstream enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD). We used microarray analyses to define the impact of short-term (ie. seven days) NTBC therapy discontinuation on the gene expression profile of liver tissue of Fah-deficient mice. Consequently, we investigated the modulation of canonical pathways related to oxidative stress, glutathione metabolism and liver regeneration.","The circadian clock represents an evolutionarily acquired gene network that synchronizes physiology to anticipate environmental changes caused by the succession of day and night. While most mammalian cells have a circadian clock, their synchronization depends on a central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus that integrates light signals. While peripheral organs can be also synchronized by feeding cues and can be uncoupled from the central pacemaker, no impact of peripheral organs on the central clock has been yet observed. Here, we used a mouse chimeric model in which mouse hepatocytes have been replaced by human hepatocytes that have different circadian and signaling properties to characterize such potential feedback. Remarkably, we observed that liver humanization rewired the liver diurnal gene expression and advance the circadian clock by approximately 4 hours. Strikingly, this phase advance was also observed in the muscle and for the entire rhythmic physiology of the animals, with an impact of human hepatocytes on the circadian function of the central clock. Like mice with a deficient central clock, the humanized animals shifted their physiology more rapidly to the light phase under day feeding. This data prompt to reconsider the role of peripheral clocks on the central pacemaker and offers new perspective to understand the impact of diseased organs on the global circadian physiology.","Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is a severe genetic disorder that affects the liver due to a defective fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) enzyme in hepatocytes. The drug nitisinone (NTBC) has offered a life-saving treatment for HT1 patients by inhibiting the upstream enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD). We used microarray analyses to to identify changes in molecular pathways associated to the development and progression of the liver pathogenesis of HT1 that remain uncorrected under NTBC therapy by using gene expression profiling of Fah-deficient mouse livers subjected to continuous NTBC therapy and after seven days of NTBC therapy discontinuation. As a control of a TIMD without hepatic manifestation, we used the Hgd-deficient mouse model of AKU, also under continuous NTBC treatment and after seven days of NTBC therapy discontinuation. Consequently, we identified a set of 25 genes that discriminates HT1 livers from AKU livers, even under continuous NTBC therapy, as such representing remnants of an HT1-driven residual uncorrected liver disease phenotype.","DNA transposon-based gene delivery vectors represent a promising new branch of randomly integrating vector development for gene therapy. For the side-by-side evaluation of the piggyBac and Sleeping Beauty systems - the only DNA transposons currently employed in clinical trials - during therapeutic intervention, we treated the mouse model of Tyrosinemia type I. with liver-targeted gene delivery using both transposon vectors. For genome-wide mapping of transposon insertion sites we developed a new Next Generation Sequencing procedure called Streptavidin-Based Enrichment Sequencing, which allowed us to identify approximately 1 million integration sites for both systems. We revealed that a high proportion of piggyBac integrations are clustered in hot regions and found that they are frequently recurring at the same genomic positions among treated animals, indicating that the genome-wide distribution of Sleeping Beauty-generated integrations is closer to random. We also revealed that the piggyBac transposase protein exhibits prolonged activity, which predicts the risk of oncogenesis by generating chromosomal double-strand breaks. Safety concerns associated with prolonged transpositional activity draw attention to the importance of squeezing the active state of the transposase enzymes into a narrower time window.","Conventional therapy for hereditary tyrosinemia type-1 (HT1) with 2-(2-nitro-4-  trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) delays and in some cases fails to prevent  disease progression to liver fibrosis, liver failure, and activation of tumorigenic pathways. Here  we demonstrate for the first time a cure of HT1 by direct, in vivo administration of a therapeutic  lentiviral vector targeting the expression of a human fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH)  transgene in the porcine model of HT1. This therapy was well tolerated and provided stable  long-term expression of FAH in pigs with HT1. Genomic integration displayed a benign profile,  with subsequent fibrosis and tumorigenicity gene expression patterns similar to wild-type  animals as compared to NTBC-treated or diseased untreated animals. Indeed, the phenotypic and  genomic data following in vivo lentiviral vector administration demonstrate comparative  superiority over other therapies including ex vivo cell therapy and therefore support clinical  application of this approach.","Clinical application of somatic genome editing requires therapeutics that are generalizable to a broad range of patients. Targeted insertion of promoterless transgenes can ensure that edits are permanent, broadly applicable, while minimizing risks of off-target integration. In the liver, the Albumin locus is currently the only well characterized site for promoterless transgene insertion. Using an unbiased ChIP-seq approach, we here identify Apolipoprotein a1 (Apoa1) as one of the most highly expressed and accessible loci in mouse and human liver. We target the Apoa1 locus with Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) delivery of CRISPR/Cas9, and achieve rates of 6 to 16% with no evidence of toxicity. We further show that the endogenous Apoa1 promoter can drive robust and sustained expression of therapeutic proteins such as factor IX (FIX) or apolipoprotein E (APOE). Finally, we demonstrate that Apoa1-targeted fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) can correct and rescue the severe metabolic liver disease hereditary tyrosinemia type I. In summary, we identify and validate Apoa1 as novel safe harbor site for genome editing therapeutics.","Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is a severe genetic disorder that affects the liver due to a defective fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) enzyme in hepatocytes.

Simultaneous delivery of multiple vectors can limit dose and efficacy and increase safety risks. The use of compact effectors has enabled single-AAV delivery of Cas9s with 1-3 guides for edits that use end-joining repair pathways, but many precise edits that correct disease-causing mutations in vivo require homology-directed repair (HDR) templates. Here, we describe  single-vector, ~4.8-kb AAV platforms that express Nme2Cas9 and either two sgRNAs to produce segmental deletions, or a single sgRNA with an HDR template. We also examine the utility of Nme2Cas9 target sites in the vector for self-inactivation. We demonstrate that these platforms can effectively treat two disease models [type I hereditary tyrosinemia (HT-I) and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I)] in mice. These results will enable single-vector AAVs to achieve diverse therapeutic genome editing outcomes.","Mutations in the metabolic enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) cause hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1) in human. HT1 patients present acute and irreversible liver and kidney damage during infancy. CRISPR/Cas9-medated precise correction of disease-causing mutations in the liver of infant may provide a promising approach for the treatment of monogenetic liver metabolic disorders. However, to date, all previous precise gene therapy studies were conducted in adult HT1 rodent models (mice and rats), which are not able to recover irreversible pathological changes and result in less treatment effectiveness. In addition, rodent animals have very tiny livers comparing with that of humans, and HT1 rodent models do not authentically recapitulate some symptoms of human patients such as kidney damage. Therefore, to achieve the data which could be more translationable to medical practice of HT1 disease treatment by correcting gene mutation of hepatocytes, here, we chose a HT1 rabbit model, owning relatively large livers, and displaying liver and kidney damage as human patients, as the subject to test the gene therapy effectiveness starting from newborn stage. By delivery CRISPR/Cas9 system and donor templates to the livers by ear vein injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV), HT1 rabbits could be rescued the lethal phenotypes and were able to grow up to adult normally without NTBC treatment and give birth to offspring. In the livers of AAV-treated HT1 rabbits, both HDR-mediated and NHEJ-mediated gene corrections were occurred with the efficiencies ranged from 3.30% to 8.58%. Gene corrected HT1 rabbits showed normal structure and function of both livers and kidneys.

Therefore, special factors could regulate metabolic processes and influence the overall status of tumor cells. This phenomenon was obviously found in melanoma. Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (fumarylacetoacetase, FAH) is an enzyme encoded by the FAH gene located on the chromosome 15q25.1 region and contains 14 exons. FAH enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of 4- fumarylacetoacetase into fumarate and acetoacetate. It is the last enzyme in the subpathway from L-phenylalanine and tyrosine degradation. Mutations in the FAH gene cause type I tyrosinemia, which is a hereditary error of metabolism that is characterized by increased tyrosine levels in the blood and urine of patients. In the present study, we will explore whether FAH is an essential enzyme to promote multiple metabolic processes and elucidate the functions of FAH in melanoma. Gene microarrays and bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed using A375 cells, and we concentrated on the biologic functions of FAH. In general, our work revealed several functional mechanisms of FAH in melanoma, which indicated FAH might be a potentially therapeutic target and an independent prognostic indicator for this disease.","To gain a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of liver repopulation after injury, we utilize an innovative technique to profile the expression changes and chromatin landscape during the regenerative response. We utilize the Fah-/- mouse, a model for hereditary tyrosinemia deficient in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), that undergoes repopulation with FAH-expressing hepatocytes. We employ translating ribosome affinity purification followed by RNA-sequencing (TRAP-seq) and assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to specifically isolate regenerating hepatocytes and performed high-throughput sequencing to identify the dynamic genomic and epigenomic changes during liver repopulation.","Autism is present in 1% of the population, yet treatments are extremely limited. We identified homozygous inactivating mutations in the BCKDK gene in families presenting with autism and epilepsy. The encoded branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase protein is responsible for phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of the E1-alpha subunit of branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, itself mutated in Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD). Patients with homozygous BCKDK mutations display reductions in BCKDK mRNA and protein, E1-alpha phosphorylation and serum branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). Bckdk knockout mice show abnormal brain amino acids profiles and neurobehavioral defects, which are largely corrected by dietary BCAA supplementation. Thus autism presenting with epilepsy due to BCKDK mutations represent a new and potentially treatable disease.","Over half of the mature hepatocytes in mice and humans are aneuploid and yet retain full ability to undergo mitosis. This observation has raised the question of whether this unusual somatic genetic variation evolved as an adaptive mechanism in response to hepatic injury. According to this model, hepatotoxic insults select for hepatocytes with specific numerical chromosome abnormalities, rendering them differentially resistant to injury. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a strain of mice heterozygous for a mutation in the homogentisic acid dioxygenase (Hgd) gene located on chromosome 16. Loss of the remaining Hgd allele protects from fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) deficiency, a genetic liver disease model. When adult mice heterozygous for Hgd and lacking Fah were exposed to chronic liver damage, injury-resistant nodules consisting of Hgd-null hepatocytes rapidly emerged. To determine whether aneuploidy played a role in this phenomenon, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and metaphase karyotyping were performed. Strikingly, loss of chromosome 16 was dramatically enriched in all mice that became completely resistant to tyrosinemia-induced hepatic injury. The frequency of chromosome 16-specific aneuploidy was approximately 50%. This result indicates that selection of a specific aneuploid karyotype can result in the adaptation of hepatocytes to chronic liver injury. The extent to which aneuploidy promotes hepatic adaptation in humans remains under investigation.","The use of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells as treatment for genetic diseases entails genetic repair or transfer of genetic information as a prerequisite. We have chosen the murine model of tyrosinemia type 1 (fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficiency; FAH(-/-) mice) as a paradigm for hereditary metabolic liver disorders and evaluated fibroblast-derived FAH(-/-)-iPS cell lines as targets for gene correction. By aggregating FAH(-/-)-iPS cells with tetraploid embryos, we obtained FAH-/--iPS cell–derived mice, which exhibited the phenotype of the founding FAH(-/-)-mice. We then rescued the diseased phenotype by lentiviral transduction of FAH-cDNA and performed embryo aggregation with these gene-corrected FAHgc-iPS cells to obtain viable healthy mice. Our results demonstrate that iPS cell technology is a valid approach to establish mouse disease models directly from somatic cells bearing genetic defects. Furthermore, established iPS cell lines can be genetically manipulated without loss of pluripotency for treatment of genetic diseases.","Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah), the last enzyme of the tyrosine degradation pathway, is specifically expressed in hepatocytes in the liver. Loss of Fah leads to liver failure in mice within 6-8 weeks. This can be prevented by blocking tyrosine degradation upstream of Fah with 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC). Here, we investigate the impact of p21 on global gene expression in Fah deficiency.

While cblC is due to mutations in MMACHC, which is in the cobalamin metabolic pathway, cblX is caused by mutations in the transcriptional cofactor HCFC1 and its obligate transcription factor partner RONIN . Since HCFC1 and RONIN jointly regulate MMACHC transcription, cblX patients suffer from low levels of MMACHC during development and thus develop a disease highly similar to cblC. Beyond this finding, there is little else known about the other genes de-regulated in cblX and the resulting pathophysiology. Therefore, we have generated the first mouse models of this disease (Hcfc1A115V/Y and RoninF80L/F80L). We show that our cblX models exhibit the expected metabolic perturbations, along with CNS, hematopoietic and cardiac developmental defects, typically observed in cblC patients. We also uncovered a large cohort of target genes that encode ribosome protein subunits as well as unexpected phenotypes that we ascribe to deregulation of ribosome biogenesis impacting normal translation during development. In addition to identifying RONIN and HCFC1 as new transcriptional regulators of ribosome biogenesis, we establish cblX as a complex syndrome exhibiting aspects of cblC and a ribosomopathy.","Clinical application of somatic genome editing requires therapeutics that are generalizable to a broad range of patients.

We target the Apoa1 locus with Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) delivery of CRISPR/Cas9, and achieve rates of 6 to 16% with no evidence of toxicity. We further show that the endogenous Apoa1 promoter can drive robust and sustained expression of therapeutic proteins such as factor IX (FIX) or apolipoprotein E (APOE). Finally, we demonstrate that Apoa1-targeted fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) can correct and rescue the severe metabolic liver disease hereditary tyrosinemia type I. In summary, we identify and validate Apoa1 as novel safe harbor site for genome editing therapeutics.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an established and potent independent risk factor for degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. HHcy has been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote inflammatory responses in endothelial cells (EC), and impair endothelial function, a hallmark for vascular injury. However, metabolic processes and molecular mechanisms mediating HHcy-induced endothelial injury remains to be elucidated.

This is the first study to consider the effects of HHcy on both global mRNA and miRNA expression changes for mechanism identification.

Currently, for most cancers including gastric cancer [GC], mechanisms underlying CIMP remain poorly understood. We sought to discover molecular contributors to CIMP in GC, by performing global DNA methylation, gene expression, and proteomics profiling across 14 gastric cell lines, followed by similar integrative analysis in 50 GC cell lines and 467 primary GCs. We identify the cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme (CBS) as a highly recurrent target of epigenetic silencing in CIMP GC. Likewise, we show that CBS epimutations are significantly associated with CIMP in various other cancers, occurring even in premalignant gastroesophageal conditions and longitudinally linked to clinical persistence. Of note, CRISPR deletion of CBS in normal gastric epithelial cells induces widespread DNA methylation changes that overlap with primary GC CIMP patterns. Reflecting its metabolic role as a gatekeeper interlinking the methionine and homocysteine cycles, CBS loss in vitro also causes reductions in the anti-inflammatory gasotransmitter hydrogen sulphide (H2S), with concomitant increase in NF-κB activity.  In a murine genetic model of CBS-deficiency, preliminary data indicate upregulated immune-mediated transcriptional signatures in the stomach.  Our results implicate CBS as a bi-faceted modifier of aberrant DNA methylation and inflammation in GC and highlights H2S donors as a potential new therapy for CBS-silenced lesions.

We also examine the utility of Nme2Cas9 target sites in the vector for self-inactivation. We demonstrate that these platforms can effectively treat two disease models [type I hereditary tyrosinemia (HT-I) and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I)] in mice. These results will enable single-vector AAVs to achieve diverse therapeutic genome editing outcomes.","Background &amp; Aims: Existing drug therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including sorafenib, extend patient survival by only three months. We sought to identify novel druggable targets for use in combination with sorafenib to increase its efficacy. Methods: We implemented an in vivo genetic screening paradigm utilizing a library of 43 genes-of-interest expressed in the context of repopulation of the injured livers of Fumarylacetoacetate Hydrolase-deficient (Fah-/-) mice, which led to highly penetrant HCC. We treated mice with vehicle or sorafenib, then determined the genetic drivers of each tumor from the library. Liver X Receptor alpha (LXRalpha) emerged as a potential target. To examine LXRalpha agonism in combination with sorafenib treatment, we added varying concentrations of sorafenib and LXRalpha agonist drugs to HCC cell lines. To elucidate the mechanism of tumor death, we performed transcriptomic analysis. Results: Fah-/- mice injected with the screening library developed HCC tumor clones containing Myc cDNA plus various other cDNAs. Treatment with sorafenib resulted in sorafenib-resistant HCCs that were significantly depleted in Nr1h3 cDNA, encoding LXRalpha, suggesting that LXRalpha activation is incompatible with tumor growth in the presence of sorafenib treatment in vivo. Combination treatment using sorafenib and LXR agonist drugs in multiple HCC cell lines led to enhanced cell death as compared to monotherapy, due to reduced expression of cell cycle regulators and increased expression of genes associated with apoptosis. Combination therapy also enhanced cell death in a sorafenib-resistant primary human HCC cell line. Conclusions: We have completed a novel drug resistance screen in vivo, and identified that LXR agonism potentiates the efficacy of sorafenib in treating HCC.","Mutations in the metabolic enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) cause hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1) in human. HT1 patients present acute and irreversible liver and kidney damage during infancy. CRISPR/Cas9-medated precise correction of disease-causing mutations in the liver of infant may provide a promising approach for the treatment of monogenetic liver metabolic disorders. However, to date, all previous precise gene therapy studies were conducted in adult HT1 rodent models (mice and rats), which are not able to recover irreversible pathological changes and result in less treatment effectiveness. In addition, rodent animals have very tiny livers comparing with that of humans, and HT1 rodent models do not authentically recapitulate some symptoms of human patients such as kidney damage. Therefore, to achieve the data which could be more translationable to medical practice of HT1 disease treatment by correcting gene mutation of hepatocytes, here, we chose a HT1 rabbit model, owning relatively large livers, and displaying liver and kidney damage as human patients, as the subject to test the gene therapy effectiveness starting from newborn stage. By delivery CRISPR/Cas9 system and donor templates to the livers by ear vein injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV), HT1 rabbits could be rescued the lethal phenotypes and were able to grow up to adult normally without NTBC treatment and give birth to offspring. In the livers of AAV-treated HT1 rabbits, both HDR-mediated and NHEJ-mediated gene corrections were occurred with the efficiencies ranged from 3.30% to 8.58%. Gene corrected HT1 rabbits showed normal structure and function of both livers and kidneys. This study in rabbits provides useful large-animal preclinical data to treat genetic metabolic disorders affecting the liver with gene therapy.","Mutations in the metabolic enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) cause hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1) in human.

Therefore, special factors could regulate metabolic processes and influence the overall status of tumor cells. This phenomenon was obviously found in melanoma. Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (fumarylacetoacetase, FAH) is an enzyme encoded by the FAH gene located on the chromosome 15q25.1 region and contains 14 exons. FAH enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of 4- fumarylacetoacetase into fumarate and acetoacetate. It is the last enzyme in the subpathway from L-phenylalanine and tyrosine degradation. Mutations in the FAH gene cause type I tyrosinemia, which is a hereditary error of metabolism that is characterized by increased tyrosine levels in the blood and urine of patients. In the present study, we will explore whether FAH is an essential enzyme to promote multiple metabolic processes and elucidate the functions of FAH in melanoma. Gene microarrays and bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed using A375 cells, and we concentrated on the biologic functions of FAH. In general, our work revealed several functional mechanisms of FAH in melanoma, which indicated FAH might be a potentially therapeutic target and an independent prognostic indicator for this disease.","To gain a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of liver repopulation after injury, we utilize an innovative technique to profile the expression changes and chromatin landscape during the regenerative response. We utilize the Fah-/- mouse, a model for hereditary tyrosinemia deficient in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), that undergoes repopulation with FAH-expressing hepatocytes. We employ translating ribosome affinity purification followed by RNA-sequencing (TRAP-seq) and assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to specifically isolate regenerating hepatocytes and performed high-throughput sequencing to identify the dynamic genomic and epigenomic changes during liver repopulation.","CblX is a recently described X-linked variant of combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblC type, which is the most common inborn error of intracellular cobalamin metabolism. While cblC is due to mutations in MMACHC, which is in the cobalamin metabolic pathway, cblX is caused by mutations in the transcriptional cofactor HCFC1 and its obligate transcription factor partner RONIN . Since HCFC1 and RONIN jointly regulate MMACHC transcription, cblX patients suffer from low levels of MMACHC during development and thus develop a disease highly similar to cblC. Beyond this finding, there is little else known about the other genes de-regulated in cblX and the resulting pathophysiology. Therefore, we have generated the first mouse models of this disease (Hcfc1A115V/Y and RoninF80L/F80L). We show that our cblX models exhibit the expected metabolic perturbations, along with CNS, hematopoietic and cardiac developmental defects, typically observed in cblC patients. We also uncovered a large cohort of target genes that encode ribosome protein subunits as well as unexpected phenotypes that we ascribe to deregulation of ribosome biogenesis impacting normal translation during development. In addition to identifying RONIN and HCFC1 as new transcriptional regulators of ribosome biogenesis, we establish cblX as a complex syndrome exhibiting aspects of cblC and a ribosomopathy.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an established and potent independent risk factor for degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. HHcy has been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote inflammatory responses in endothelial cells (EC), and impair endothelial function, a hallmark for vascular injury. However, metabolic processes and molecular mechanisms mediating HHcy-induced endothelial injury remains to be elucidated. This study examined the effects of HHcy on the expression of mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) in human aortic endothelial cells treated with a pathophysiologically relevant concentration of homocysteine (Hcy 500 μM).  This is the first study to consider the effects of HHcy on both global mRNA and miRNA expression changes for mechanism identification. Molecular axes and biochemical processes identified in this study are useful not only for the understanding of mechanisms underlying HHcy-induced endothelial injury, but also for discovering therapeutic targets for CVD in general.","Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an established and potent independent risk factor for degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.

Currently, for most cancers including gastric cancer [GC], mechanisms underlying CIMP remain poorly understood. We sought to discover molecular contributors to CIMP in GC, by performing global DNA methylation, gene expression, and proteomics profiling across 14 gastric cell lines, followed by similar integrative analysis in 50 GC cell lines and 467 primary GCs. We identify the cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme (CBS) as a highly recurrent target of epigenetic silencing in CIMP GC. Likewise, we show that CBS epimutations are significantly associated with CIMP in various other cancers, occurring even in premalignant gastroesophageal conditions and longitudinally linked to clinical persistence. Of note, CRISPR deletion of CBS in normal gastric epithelial cells induces widespread DNA methylation changes that overlap with primary GC CIMP patterns. Reflecting its metabolic role as a gatekeeper interlinking the methionine and homocysteine cycles, CBS loss in vitro also causes reductions in the anti-inflammatory gasotransmitter hydrogen sulphide (H2S), with concomitant increase in NF-κB activity.  In a murine genetic model of CBS-deficiency, preliminary data indicate upregulated immune-mediated transcriptional signatures in the stomach.  Our results implicate CBS as a bi-faceted modifier of aberrant DNA methylation and inflammation in GC and highlights H2S donors as a potential new therapy for CBS-silenced lesions. ","The industrial solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) produces a marked formic aciduria in male and female F344 rats and in male C57Bl mice following single or multiple dosing. The two major metabolites of TCE formed by cytochromes P450 metabolism also produce formic aciduria. The quantity of formic acid excreted was about 2-fold higher following trichloroacetic acid (TCA) compared to trichloroethanol (TCE-OH) or TCE, at similar doses of 16mg/kg/day for 3 days. Prior treatment of male F344 rats with 1-aminobenzotriazole a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, followed by TCE, completely prevented the formic aciduria but had no effect on formic acid excretion produced by TCA, suggesting TCA is the proximate metabolite producing this response. Metabolism of formic acid is largely controlled by the vitamin B12 –dependent methionine salvage pathway. Transcriptomic analysis on the liver of rats dosed with 16mg/kg/day TCE for three days when compared to control liver showed nine differentially expressed genes, of particular interest was the down regulation of  LMBRD1   involved in the conversion of vitamin B12 into one of two molecules, methylcobalamin (CH3Cbl) or S-adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). Administration of CH3Cbl or hydroxocobalamin for 3 days to rats given a single dose of TCE, lead to a reduction in formic acid in their urine. Similarly, rats given TCE followed by L-methionine for 3 days excreted less formic acid in their urine. These findings suggest an effect on the vitamin B12 –dependent methionine salvage pathway. This was supported by the finding that hepatic methionine synthase, which converts homocysteine to methionine, was inhibited following three large daily dose of TCE. We propose that TCE metabolites interact with the vitamin B12 -dependent methionine salvage pathway leading to tetrahydrofolate deficiency and increased excretion of formic acid in rat urine.","Cobalamin C deficiency (cblC), the most common inborn error of intracellular cobalamin metabolism, is caused by mutations in MMACHC, a gene responsible for the processing and intracellular trafficking of vitamin B12. This recessive disorder is characterized by a failure to metabolize cobalamin into adenosyl- and methylcobalamin, which results in the biochemical perturbations of methylmalonic acidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, and hypomethioninemia caused by impaired activity of the downstream enzymes, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase. Cobalamin C deficiency can be accompanied by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including progressive blindness, and in mice, manifests with very early embryonic lethality. Because zebrafish harbor a full complement of cobalamin metabolic enzymes, we used genome editing to study loss of mmachc function. mmachc homozygotes survived the embryonic period but perished in early juvenile life. The mutants displayed metabolic and clinical features of cblC deficiency including methylmalonic acidemia, severe growth retardation, and lethality. Clinical and metabolic parameters improved when the mutants were raised in water supplemented with small molecules used to treat patients, including hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, methionine, and betaine. Furthermore, mmachc mutants, some bred to express rod and or cone fluorescent reporters, manifested a retinopathy and thin optic nerves. Expression analysis using whole eye mRNA revealed dysregulation of genes involved in phototransduction and cholesterol metabolism. Zebrafish with mmachc deficiency recapitulate the phenotypic and biochemical features of the human disorder, including ocular pathology, and a show a response to established treatments","DNA methylation is essential for silencing transposable elements and some genes in higher eukaryotes, implying that this modification must be tightly controlled. However, accidental changes in DNA methylation can be transmitted through mitosis, as in cancer, or meiosis, leading to epiallelic variation. Here, we demonstrate the existence of an efficient and faithful mechanism that protects against transgenerational loss of DNA methylation in the plant Arabidopsis. This process is specific to the subset of heavily methylated genomic repeats that are targeted by the RNAi machinery, and does not spread into flanking regions. Remethylation is often progressive over two to four sexual generations. This differential and incremental correction of epigenetic defects may preserve genome stability while increasing adaptive opportunities.","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","Human Aortic Endothelial  Cells","This study investigates how master splicing regulators interact and the extent to which transcription regulators are spliced differently during brain development. Cell-type-specific RNA-Seq analyses of the developing neocortex uncover variable expression of the Rbfox1/2/3 genes and enriched splicing events in transcription regulators, altering protein isoforms or inducing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Transient expression of Rbfox proteins in radial glial progenitors induces neuronal splicing events preferentially in transcription regulators such as Meis2 and Tead1. Surprisingly, Rbfox proteins promote the inclusion of a mammal-specific alternative exon and a previously undescribed poison exon in Ptbp1. Simultaneous ablation of Rbfox1/2/3 in the neocortex downregulates neuronal isoforms and disrupts radial neuronal migration. Furthermore, the progenitor isoform of Meis2 promotes Tgfb3 transcription, while the Meis2 neuron isoform promotes neuronal differentiation. These observations indicate that transcription regulators are differentially spliced between cell types in the developing neocortex.","The intestinal mucosal barrier is a dynamic system that allows nutrient uptake, stimulates healthy microbe-host interactions, and prevents invasion by pathogens. The mucosa consists of epithelial cells connected by cellular junctions that regulate the passage of nutrients covered by a mucus layer that plays an important role in host-microbiome interactions. Mimicking the intestinal mucosa for in vitro assays, in particular the generation of a viscous mucus layer, has proven to be challenging. Here, we present a novel in vitro intestinal culture model that produces a robust mucus layer and is based on the widely used intestinal Caco-2 cell line. We investigated the effects of air-liquid interface (ALI) culturing compared to liquid-liquid interface (LLI) on Caco-2 cells grown under low-glucose conditions in Transwell plates. In addition, we determined the impact of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) on mucus secretion, epithelial barrier properties and microbe-mucus interactions. A combination of ALI culturing with VIP addition led to formation of a robust mucus layer on the apical surface of the Caco-2 confluent layer in which the intestinal secreted mucin MUC2 was a major component. RNAseq analysis demonstrated upregulation of unique gene clusters in response to ALI and VIP conditions, but the ALI-VIP combination treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of multiple mucin genes and proteins including MUC2, MUC13 and MUC17. Expression of tight junction proteins was significantly altered in the ALI-VIP condition leading to increased permeability to small molecules, more closely reflecting an intestinal epithelium permissive for nutrient uptake. In infection experiments with commensal Lactobacillus plantarum, pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the ALI-VIP mucus layer separated the bacteria from the underlying epithelium. In conclusion, ALI-VIP culture of Caco-2 cells provides an attractive in vitro model to study the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier and pathogenic and commensal microbe-host interactions.","Nogo-A is a major regulator of neural development and regeneration in the central nervous system, but its role in tooth innervation remains largely unknown. Neurons of the trigeminal ganglion innervate the teeth. We showed that Nogo-A is expressed in the trigeminal ganglion and tooth-related nerve fibres. Nogo-A deletion in mice leads to a less complex neuronal network when compared to wild-type animals. Bulk RNA sequencing on the trigeminal ganglia of Nogo-A KO and wild-type mice revealed gene expression changes associated with alterations in neurotrophin signalling and neuronal synaptic formation during the development and maturation of the trigeminal neurons.","B cell somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection in germinal center (GC)s enhance antibody affinity to antigen. Conventional understanding holds that SHM enhances pre-existing antibody specificities, limiting the scope of SHM-based antibody evolution to those established in the primary repertoire through V(D)J recombination. By tracking pre-defined non-specific B cells, we observed consistent SHM in non-cognate antibody genes after immunization in settings of diverse, polyclonal B and T cells. Removing B cell competition enabled these non-specific yet somatically mutating antibodies to develop entirely new specificities to diverse antigens. Our findings introduce an updated model, where SHM drives antibody diversification without requiring initial antigen specificity. This reveals that B cell competition, rather than a necessity for specific affinity, limits the emergence of new affinities (termed here as affinity birth) by SHM and highlights the mammalian adaptive immune system’s capacity to explore antibody-antigen interactions beyond the epitopes targeted by the V(D)J-dependent primary antibody repertoire.","The activation of fibroblasts and production of extracellular matrix (ECM) after cardiac injury has been the focus of research on cardiac fibrosis. Whether imprinted genes play a role in the fibrogenesis or extracellular matrix production after heart damage has not been studied. Here, we show that the imprinted gene Pw1 directed ECM production by regulating de novo purine synthesis (DNPB) after myocardial infarction (MI). After MI, the DNA methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) of Pw1 gene in the injured area was reduced and both alleles of Pw1 in fibroblasts are activated. Further, loss of Pw1 in fibroblasts can enhance cardiac function, reduce cardiac fibrosis and extracellular matrix secretion after cardiac injury. To screen the targets of PW1, we contrasted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and RNA-seq using the injured left ventricles at 7 days post-MI, we next found PW1 binds directly upstream of the Pfas gene that encodes one of the DNPB enzymes phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS) in heart after injury. Similarly, specific knockout of pfas in fibroblasts also improves cardiac function and reduces ECM production. Moreover, de novo purine biosynthesis is necessary for ECM production in activated fibroblasts. These observations implicate understanding the mechanism of Pw1 in the repair of cardiac injury will provide new ideas for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","Gene regulatory mechanisms that modulate RNA Polymerase II activity are difficult to access in mammalian tissues composed of multiple cell lineages. Here, we develop a nascent RNA assay (PReCIS-seq) that measures lineage-specific transcriptionally-engaged Pol II on genes and DNA enhancer elements in intact mouse tissue. By employing keratinocytes as a prototype lineage, we unearth Pol II promoter-recruitment versus pause-release mechanisms operating in adult skin homeostasis. Moreover, we relate active enhancer proximity and transcription factor binding motifs on promoters to Pol II activity and promoter-proximal pausing level. Finally, we find Pol II firing rapidly into elongation on lineage identity genes and highly paused on cellular safeguarding genes in a context-dependent manner.

Direct co-culture of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one of the origins of CAFs, with ESCC cell line, led to increased amphiregulin (AREG) expression and secretion in the ESCC cells. Consequently, the expression and phosphorylation of the AREG receptor EGFR were upregulated in co-cultured ESCC cells. Moreover, AREG treatment enhanced ESCC cell survival and migration through the EGFR-Erk/p38 signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis of AREG using human ESCC tissues showed a positive correlation between the intensity of AREG expression in tumor invasive front and the expression level of the CAF marker FAP. Furthermore, bioinformatics database analysis confirmed a significant upregulation of AREG expression in ESCC tissues compared to normal tissues. These findings suggest that AREG is involved in CAF-mediated ESCC progression and could be a novel therapeutic target for ESCC.","Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction caused by obesity can be associated with alterations in the levels of microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the role of miRNAs in such processes remains elusive. Here, we show that pancreatic islet miR-27a-5p, which is markedly increased in obese mice and impairs insulin secretion, is mainly delivered by visceral adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Depleting miR-27a-5p significantly improves insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in db/db mice. Supporting the function of EVs’ miR-27a-5p as a key pathogenic factor, intravenous injection of miR-27a-5p-containing EVs shows their distribution in mouse pancreatic islets. Tracing the injected AAV-miR-27a-5p (AAV-miR-27a) or AAV-FABP4-miR-27a-5p (AAV-FABP4-miR-27a) in visceral fat results in upregulating miR-27a-5p in EVs and serum, and elicits mouse pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, miR-27a-5p directly targets L-type Ca2+ channel subtype CaV1.2 (Cacna1c) and reduces insulin secretion in β-cells. Overexpressing mouse CaV1.2 largely abolishes the insulin secretion injury induced by miR-27a-5p. These findings reveal a causative role of EVs’ miR-27a-5p in visceral adipocyte-mediated pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Cancer cells disseminated to distant sites enter a period of dormancy before generating overt metastases. The ability of these cells to elude immune surveillance determines their persistence as latent disease. We report that TGF-β promotes dormancy in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mouse models by placing disseminated SOX2+ and NKX2-1+ progenitors in a quiescent state that biomechanically averts killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. In these primitive progenitors, TGF-β induces an atypical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β drives expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin that changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the stiffness of metastatic progenitors and their killing by mechanosensitive CTLs and NK cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors activate a biomechanical process to evade immune-mediated elimination during prolonged dormancy periods. Inhibiting this process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells.","Chronic arsenic exposure can lead to various health issues including cancer. There has been a growing concern about co-exposure to various prevalent lifestyle habits and their role in the enhancement of arsenic toxicity. Smokeless tobacco (SLT) products are extensively consumed in many South Asian countries, where their use frequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To decipher the oral epithelial cell responses to arsenic and SLT alone and in co-exposure, we performed multi-omics analyses of DNA methylome, transcriptomic reprogramming and genotoxic effects in controlled experimental settings. Chronic exposure studies revealed hypomethylation of genes involved in inflammation response and apoptosis, further corroborated by the upregulation of genes involved in these processes due to arsenic and the combined treatment in acute exposure setting. Next, to validate the omics results at the phenotypic level, we observed a dose dependent decrease in cell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes, and an increase in apoptotic cells, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT co-exposure conditions. The observed DNA damage was likely the result of apoptosis induction, as chronic exposure experiments based on whole-exome sequencing did not reveal increased mutagenicity following the arsenic and/or SLT exposure. Our integrative omics study provides insights into both chronic and acute responses to arsenic and SLT co-exposure, with both types of responses converging on some of the same mechanisms. We identified large-scale epigenomic and transcriptomic reprograming associated with arsenic and SLT co-exposure, alongside genotoxic effects presumably manifesting as consequences of apoptosis induction. The findings point to a role of arsenic and SLT in altering key molecular responses, especially in the context of the co-exposure, and call for further studies in humans in the areas of exposure, to validate the observed mechanisms.","The coordinate regulation of metabolic activity and epigenetics to establish cell state-specific gene expression patterns during lineage progression is among the most important aspects of cell differentiation. Cell states are defined by their epigenetic landscape and have cell state-specific metabolic demands. Defining the regulatory factors involved in the interplay between metabolism and cell state would represent a significant step forward in understanding the genetic circuitry that drives differentiation of progenitor cells into highly specialized cell types for proper tissue formation. Expression levels of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) mega-cluster have been shown to correlate with distinct metabolic profiles in a variety of progenitor cells, suggesting it functions as a key regulator of metabolism and cell state. Here, we directly demonstrate that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a central player coordinating mitochondrial metabolic activity and genome-wide epigenetic changes in myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Stable muscle cell lines were generated harboring two distinct deletions in the proximal promoter region resulting in either greatly upregulated or severely attenuated transcription of the entire mega-cluster of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. Both mutant lines displayed impaired myotube formation along with perturbed mitochondrial respiration and widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and histone methylation. Global gene expression patterns and pathway analyses indicated a reprogramming of cell state which created a differentiated-like molecular profile in proliferating myoblasts. Our results strongly suggest that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a nodal regulator coordinating metabolic activity and the epigenome to maintain proper cell state in the myogenic lineage.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal breast cancer subgroup, as lack of targeted therapies and drug resistance reduce survival rates. Cellular plasticity enables cells to adapt non-genetically and overcome therapeutic pressure, thereby embodying a critical clinical hurdle. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an example of phenotypic reprogramming linked to plasticity, drug resistance and metastasis. However, its exact impact on population diversity under therapeutic pressure is unknown. Here, we used single cell transcriptomics to investigate phenotypic diversity dynamics upon drug treatment in two human in vitro models of TNBC plasticity.","Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal breast cancer subgroup, as lack of targeted therapies and drug resistance reduce survival rates. Cellular plasticity enables cells to adapt non-genetically and overcome therapeutic pressure, thereby embodying a critical clinical hurdle. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an example of phenotypic reprogramming linked to plasticity, drug resistance and metastasis. However, its exact impact on population diversity under therapeutic pressure is unknown. Here, we used single cell transcriptomics to investigate phenotypic diversity dynamics upon drug treatment in two human in vitro models of TNBC plasticity.","The tongue facilitates vital activities such as swallowing. Swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) are common in the elderly and in many adult-onset neuromuscular diseases. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), dysphagia is often the first symptom. OPMD is an autosomal dominant myopathy caused by a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the gene encoding PABPN1. The expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble nuclear aggregates that reduce the levels of the soluble form. Clinical tongue involvement in OPMD has been documented but is poorly understood. Tongue histopathology was investigated in OPMD mouse models using light and electron microscopy. Muscle histopathology was predominantly affected by age. PABPN1 nuclear aggregates were found at moderate levels, whereas deposition of insoluble PABPN1 in blood vessels was already prominent in 4-month-old mice. RNA signatures of the OPMD tongue were enriched for mitochondrial and cytoskeletal genes, suggesting an energy and contractile deficit.

Targeting epigenome is thus a promising strategy for cancer chemotherapy. Here we report a novel histone acetylation catalyst BAHA-LANA-PEG-CPP44 that can intervene into cancer epigenome. The catalyst selectively entered leukemia cells, bound to chromatin, and acetylated endogenous histones, especially at H2BK120, in a HAT-independent manner. The catalytic histone acetylation attenuated chromatin binding of negative elongation factor E (NELFE), an RNA polymerase II pausing factor, and reprogramed transcription profile in leukemia cells. The in-cell chemical catalysis retarded proliferation of leukemia cells and reduced their tumorigenic potential in mice. Our catalyst is orthogonal to cancer epigenetic drugs targeting histone-modifying enzymes and may lead to a novel anti-cancer strategy.","Chemical modification of histones dynamically regulates gene transcription and is closely related to disease pathogenesis including cancer.

The distribution of species however varies greatly. Although C. parapsilosis is more likely to resemble skin commensals, opinions are divided, and discrepancies are present regarding C. albicans, that is also often associated with cutaneous candidiasis. Therefore, we aimed to thoroughly assess the nature of skin epithelial cell - Candida interactions. To study species-specific host reponses, we examined phagocytosis, cytokine and metabolic responses in different keratinocytes (HaCaT, HPV-KER) along with host cell damage following fungal stimuli. These results suggest that C. albicans triggers an enhanced antifungal response, thus does not closely resembe skin commensals, like C. parapsilosis. Furthermore, HPV-KER might serve as a more applicable tool for studying keratinocyte antifungal responses. To rigorously examine yeast-keratinocyte interactions, we applied two distinct isolates of both C. albicans (SC5314, WO-1) and C. parapsilosis (GA1, CLIB214). Comparison of the two fungi’s virulence revealed that while C. albicans effectively adheres to human keratinocytes and causes subsequent damage, C. parapsilosis is unable to establish lasting physical contact and causes less harm. In terms of keratinocyte response, both cell lines showed significantly enhanced cellular (% phagocytosis), humoral (IL-6, IL-8) and metabolic responses (2-ketoglutaric acid, citric acid, threorine, hypotaurine) to C. albicans strains, while those towards C. parapsilosis remained relatively low or similar to the control condition. Under certain conditions strain preference was also detected. Of the two cell lines, HPV-KER was more sensitive, as besides interspecies differences, intraspecies differences were also measurable.","Combat veterans from the Persian Gulf War have unexplained yet persistent impairment in colonic motility due to combat-related toxic exposures. Central to Gulf War-related toxic exposures was the unmitigated ingestion of Pyridostigmine bromide (PB). We previously developed a Gulf War Illness (GWI) mouse model, where acute PB exposure led to immediate disruptions in colonic motility. Here, we explore mechanisms by which acute enteric neuroinflammation produces peristent impairment in colonic motility. GWI mice were exposed to PB transiently, and allowed to recover with no exposures for 1 month. GWI mice had significantly increased amplitudes of colonic contraction and diminished nerve-stimulated colonic relaxation, compared to naive controls. Immunohistological characterization demonstrated persistent chronic damage in enteric neuronal network integrity, accompanied by a significant imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory motor neuronal populations. Inflammatory CD40+ tissue- resident macrophages were identified with enteric neural stem cells in GWI colons, with an increase in secreted inflammatory cytokines. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis corroborated peristent low grade enteric neuroinflammation, overall resulting in impaired repair and regeneration of neural circuity in GWI. Our learnings can be leveraged to design new regenerative therapies for Gulf War veterans, and broadly impact our understanding of severeal inflammatory disorders of the gut.","The embryonic loss during early stage of gestation is one of the major causes of infertility for domestic ruminants, causing huge economic losses to pasture. Maternal recognition of pregnancy and implantation are the crucial process for determining the successful establishment and development of pregnancy in cattle. The research on molecular mechanisms of pregnancy recognition will facilitate illustrating the complex process of pregnancy establishment and help to improve pregnancy outcomes. In this study, we performed transcriptomic analysis of primary bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEND) with or without IFNT and hormones intervention through RNA sequencing. We eventually identified 608 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 409 up-regulated genes and 199 down-regulated genes in IFNT and hormones-treated group compared with control group. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis demonstrated that the majority of DEGs were implicated in immune system process, response to external stimulus, response to cytokine, regulation of response to stress. Results from KEGG analysis showed a significant enrichment of NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation, necroptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. Additionally, a set of promising candidate genes, including (USP18, STAT1, PSMB8, IFIH1, MX2, IFI44, DHX58, CASP8, DRAM1, CXCR4), were characterized by constructing an integrated interaction network.","GM1 gangliosidosis is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in theGLB1gene, which encodes lysosomalb-galactosidase. The enzyme deficiency blocks GM1 ganglioside catabolism, leading to accumulation of GM1 ganglioside and asialo-GM1 ganglioside (GA1 glycolipid) in brain. This disease can present in varying degrees of severity, with the level of residualb-galactosidase activity primarily determining the clinical course.Glb1null mouse models, which completely lackb-galactosidase expression, exhibit a less severe form of the disease than expected from the comparable deficiency in humans, suggesting a potential species difference in the GM1 ganglioside degradation pathway. We hypothesized this difference may involve the sialidase NEU3, which acts on GM1 ganglioside to produce GA1 glycolipid. To test this hypothesis, we generatedGlb1/Neu3double knockout (DKO) mice. These mice had a significantly shorter lifespan, increased neurodegeneration, and more severe ataxia thanGlb1KO mice.Glb1/Neu3DKO mouse brains exhibited an increased GM1 ganglioside to GA1 glycolipid ratio compared withGlb1KO mice, indicating that Neu3 mediated GM1 ganglioside to GA1 glycolipid conversion inGlb1KO mice. The expression of genes associated with neuroinflammation and glial responses were enhanced inGlb1/Neu3DKO mice compared withGlb1KO mice. Mouse Neu3 more efficiently converted GM1 ganglioside to GA1 glycolipid than human NEU3 did. Our findings highlight Neu3’s role in ameliorating the consequences ofGlb1deletion in mice, provide insights into NEU3’s differential effects between mice and humans in GM1 gangliosidosis, and offer a potential therapeutic approach for reducing toxic GM1 ganglioside accumulation in GM1 gangliosidosis patients.","Living organisms are intricate systems with dynamic internal processes. Their RNA, protein, and metabolite levels fluctuate in response to variations in health and environmental conditions. Among these, RNA expression is particularly accessible for comprehensive analysis, thanks to the evolution of high throughput sequencing technologies in recent years. This progress has enabled researchers to identify unique RNA patterns associated with various diseases, as well as to develop predictive and prognostic biomarkers for therapy response. Such cross-sectional studies allow for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups, but they have limitations. Specifically, they often fail to capture the temporal changes in gene expression following individual perturbations and may lead to significant false discoveries due to inherent noise in RNA sequencing sample preparation and data collection. To address these challenges, our study hypothesized that frequent, longitudinal RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis of blood samples could offer a more profound understanding of the temporal dynamics of gene expression in response to drug interventions, while also enhancing the accuracy of identifying genes influenced by these drugs. In this research, we conducted RNAseq on 829 blood samples collected from 84 Sprague-Dawley lab rats. Excluding the control group, each rat was administered one of four different compounds known for liver toxicity: tetracycline, isoniazid, valproate, and carbon tetrachloride. We developed specialized bioinformatics tools to pinpoint genes that exhibit temporal variation in response to these treatments.","CTCF plays an important role in 3D genome organization by adjusting insulation at TAD boundaries, where clustered CBS (CTCF-binding site) elements are often arranged in tandem array with a complex divergent or convergent orientation. Here using cPcdh and HOXD loci as a paradigm, we look into the clustered CTCF TAD boundaries and find that, counterintuitively, outward-oriented CBS elements are crucial for inward enhancer-promoter interactions as well as for gene regulation. Specifically, by combinatorial deletions of a series of putative enhancer elements in vivo or CBS elements in vitro, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture and RNA-seq analyses, we show that deletions of outward-oriented CBS elements weaken the strength of long-distance intraTAD promoter-enhancer interactions and enhancer activation of target genes. Our data highlight the crucial role of outward-oriented CBS elements within the clustered CTCF TAD boundaries and have interesting implications on the organization principles of clustered CTCF sites within TAD boundaries.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","The DELLA genes encode conserved master growth repressors in plants, and they are also known as ‘Green Revolution’ genes because of their pivotal role in modulating stature of the high-yielding wheat varieties, which were crucial for the success of the ‘Green Revolution’ in the 1960s. At the cellular level, DELLA proteins are nuclear-localized transcription regulators, which play a central role in controlling plant development in response to internal and environmental cues. Recent studies indicate that DELLAs regulate expression of target genes via direct protein-protein interaction of their C-terminal GRAS domain with hundreds of key transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic regulators. However, the molecular mechanism of DELLA-mediated transcription reprogramming remains unclear. Here, by characterizing missense alleles of an Arabidopsis DELLA, REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 (RGA), we unveil a novel function of the PFYRE subdomain within its GRAS domain for binding to histone H2A via pulldown and co-IP assays. ChIP-Seq analysis further show that this activity is essential for RGA association with its target chromatin globally. Our results indicate that although DELLAs are recruited to target gene promoters by binding to TFs via its LHR1 subdomain, DELLA-H2A interaction via its PFYRE subdomain is necessary to stabilize the TF-DELLA-H2A complex at the target chromatin. This study provides new insight into the two distinct key modular functions in DELLA for its genome-wide transcription regulation in plants. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) for RGA vs rga-11 and RGA treated with GA or mock.","The DELLA genes encode conserved master growth repressors in plants, and they are also known as ‘Green Revolution’ genes because of their pivotal role in modulating stature of the high-yielding wheat varieties, which were crucial for the success of the ‘Green Revolution’ in the 1960s.

Inherited disorders of mitochondrial metabolism, including isolated methylmalonic aciduria (MMAuria), present unique challenges to this homeostasis by disrupting energetic pathways. To better understand the systemic and cellular responses to long-term energy shortage, we investigated a hemizygous mouse model of MMAuria that has a knock-in (ki) missense allele combined with a knock-out (ko) allele (Mmut-ko/ki) and shows typical clinical features including reduced growth. We found that Mmut-ko/ki (mutant) mice, compared to their Mmut-ki/wt (control) littermates, have reduced body mass along with a relative reduction in lean mass but increase in fat mass. White adipose tissue appears histologically normal, but brown adipose tissue show a process of whitening, in line with their lower body surface temperature and lesser ability to cope with cold challenge. Ad libitum fed mice show constitutive hypometabolism: they have reduced food intake, reduced energy expenditure, and reduced plasma glucose, but elevated lactate and fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21). Together, these changes culminate in a loss of metabolic flexibility in mutant mice. This is manifested in lesser ability to regulate energy sources when switching from the fed to fasted state, and in a delayed glucose clearance in response to exogenous glucose and insulin. Liver investigations find multi-metabolite accumulation and suggest upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (Ppar)- and Fgf21-controlled metabolic pathways, including beta-oxidation, and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, as molecular consequences. Altogether, this study identifies a multi-faceted metabolic response to chronic energy shortage in MMAuria and suggests hypometabolism combined with dysregulated adaptive capability to be underlying features.","Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) is a key enzyme integral to the hepatic urea cycle which is required for ammonia detoxification, and the citrulline-nitric oxide (NO) cycle for NO production. ASL deficient patients present with argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA), an inherited metabolic disease with hyperammonaemia and a chronic systemic phenotype with neurocognitive impairment and chronic liver disease. ASL deficiency as an inherited model of systemic NO deficiency, shows enhanced nitrosative and oxidative stress. Here, we describe the dysregulation of glutathione biosynthesis and upstream cysteine utilization in ASL-deficient patients and mice using targeted metabolomics and in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using (S)-4-(3-18F-fluoropropyl)-L-glutamate ([18F]FSPG). Upregulation of cysteine metabolism contrasted with glutathione depletion and down-regulated antioxidant pathways. hASL mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles corrected and rescued the neonatal and adult Asl-deficient mouse phenotypes, respectively, enhancing ureagenesis and glutathione metabolism and ameliorating chronic liver disease. We further present [18F]FSPG PET as a novel non-invasive diagnostic tool to assess liver disease and therapeutic efficacy in ASA. These findings support clinical translation of mRNA therapy for ASA.","Zanthoxylum armatum is a prominent plant for food industries. However, its male flowers often occurred in gynogenesis plants, the potential mechanism remains poorly understood. Herein, a total of 26 floral sex differentiation stages were observed to select four vital periods to reveal key factors using RNA-seq, phytohormones and carbohydrates investigation. Male flower was significantly associated with cytokinin and sucrose signals, whereas female flower was initiated by SA, GA1, and ABA pathways. The floral organ identity genes were attributed to ABCDE model. Eleven ZaAP3/PI and four ZaSTK/SHP were exclusively up-regulated in male and female floral development, respectively. 14 DEGs were obtained to regulate the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. Finally, 21 crucial factors were identified in co-expression network from a total of 83 important members. This study provided new insights to explore the regulatory mechanism of floral sex differentiation, which would be benefited to cultivate high-yield varieties in Z. armatum.","KIT mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) confers a worse prognosis for patients in a subtype of AML that has an otherwise favorable outcome. Here, we demonstrate that lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibition potentiates cytotoxic effect of KIT inhibition in KIT mutant AML. We identified loss of PU.1 binding to be a key feature of LSD1 inhibition, contributing to a decrease in MYC enhancer and promoter activation. This loss of MYC enhancer/promoter activation results in decreased MYC expression and binding at proliferation associated promoters decreasing cell cycle progression. Our results nominate PI3K/AKT pathway inactivation as a key feature of KIT and LSD1 inhibition ultimately leading to decreased MYC and blocking LSD1 from activating its targets. Our findings support a mechanistic model for synergy between dual KIT and LSD1 inhibition and suggest this combination should be investigated in a clinical setting.","A few transformed cell lines and two historic strains have been extensively used to study respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We report a thorough molecular and cell biological characterization of HEp-2 and A549 cells infected with four strains of RSV representing both major subgroups as well as historic and more contemporary genotypes -- [RSV/A/Tracy (GA1), RSV/A/Ontario (ON), RSV/B/18537 (GB1), RSV/B/Buenos Aires (BA)] -- via measurements of viral replication kinetics and viral gene expression, immunofluorescence-based imaging of gross cellular morphology and cell-associated RSV, and measurements of host response including transcriptional changes and levels of secreted cytokines and growth factors. Our findings strongly suggest 1) the existence of a conserved difference in gene expression between RSV subgroups A and B; 2) the A549 cell line is a more stringent and natural host of replicating RSV than the HEp-2 cell line; and 3) consistent with previous studies, determining the full effects of viral genetic variation in RSV pathogenesis requires model systems as tractable as transformed cell lines but better representative of the human host.","A comparative transcriptomic analysis of the responses arising 24 hours after infection of the susceptible T. aestivum variety ‘Fielder’, by Fg with co-application of either abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid (GA) or the ABA-signaling inhibitor AS6, compared to stand-alone treatments is reported. Relevance of transcriptomic responses were assessed by differential expression feature evaluations (DEFE), highlighting that co-applied GA elicits a relatively strong opposing influence on Fg modulated genes, while co-applied ABA elicits similar responses to Fg. Co-applied AS6 elicited an opposing effect on gene regulation compared to co-applied ABA, and based on its lack of biological effect, was instrumental in reducing the identity of genes relevant to eliciting ABA and GA effects, to a subset of genes, largely defined within four DEFE patterns. A more targeted investigation of the impact of the co-applied conditions with respect to plant phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways, correlated with select phytohormone profiles, confirmed activation of the ABA and GA pathways. Further analyses highlighted a novel interaction, potentially representing cross-talk, between co-applied ABA and the brassinosteroid signaling pathway. Additional responses within the classical defense hormone pathways as well as auxin and cytokinin pathways were found to correlate with expected defense responses. Togther these results yield insight into a range of mechanisms potentially underlying the observed contributions of ABA and GA to wheat susceptibility and resistance respectively to Fg, raising novel hypotheses for consideration in the development of FHB resistant wheat lines and agronomic practices in the longer term.","Peroxisomes play an essential role in the β-oxidation of dicarboxylic acids (DCAs), which are metabolites formed upon ω-oxidation of fatty acids. The physiological functions of DCA metabolism remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the biological role of DCA metabolism using mice deficient in the peroxisomal L-bifunctional protein (Ehhadh KO mice). We performed RNA-seq in WT and Ehhadh KO livers, treated with vehicle or L-aminocarnitine (L-AC), an inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. We show that, in liver, Ehhadh KO mice have increased mRNA and protein expression of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes with decreased (in females) or similar (in males) rate of cholesterol synthesis. We conclude that EHHADH plays an essential role in the metabolism of medium-chain DCAs and postulate that peroxisomal DCA β-oxidation is a regulator of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis.","Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stresses, we examined the relevance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana.  To do so, we compared the transcriptional responses of wild type and UPR-defective seedlings to spaceflight during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially altered the expression of hundreds of stress related genes compared to ground control conditions. Although many of these genes were differentially regulated in the UPR mutants in the ground control conditions compared to wild type, their expression was largely equalized in all genotypes by flight. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.","The industrial solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) produces a marked formic aciduria in male and female F344 rats and in male C57Bl mice following single or multiple dosing. The two major metabolites of TCE formed by cytochromes P450 metabolism also produce formic aciduria. The quantity of formic acid excreted was about 2-fold higher following trichloroacetic acid (TCA) compared to trichloroethanol (TCE-OH) or TCE, at similar doses of 16mg/kg/day for 3 days. Prior treatment of male F344 rats with 1-aminobenzotriazole a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, followed by TCE, completely prevented the formic aciduria but had no effect on formic acid excretion produced by TCA, suggesting TCA is the proximate metabolite producing this response. Metabolism of formic acid is largely controlled by the vitamin B12 –dependent methionine salvage pathway. Transcriptomic analysis on the liver of rats dosed with 16mg/kg/day TCE for three days when compared to control liver showed nine differentially expressed genes, of particular interest was the down regulation of  LMBRD1   involved in the conversion of vitamin B12 into one of two molecules, methylcobalamin (CH3Cbl) or S-adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). Administration of CH3Cbl or hydroxocobalamin for 3 days to rats given a single dose of TCE, lead to a reduction in formic acid in their urine. Similarly, rats given TCE followed by L-methionine for 3 days excreted less formic acid in their urine. These findings suggest an effect on the vitamin B12 –dependent methionine salvage pathway. This was supported by the finding that hepatic methionine synthase, which converts homocysteine to methionine, was inhibited following three large daily dose of TCE. We propose that TCE metabolites interact with the vitamin B12 -dependent methionine salvage pathway leading to tetrahydrofolate deficiency and increased excretion of formic acid in rat urine.","The development of high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) methodologies has empowered the characterization of complex biological samples by dramatically increasing the number of constituent cells that can be examined concurrently. Nevertheless, these approaches typically recover substantially less information per-cell as compared to lower-throughput microtiter plate-based strategies. To uncover critical phenotypic differences among cells and effectively link scRNA-Seq observations to legacy datasets, reliable detection of phenotype-defining transcripts – such as transcription factors, affinity receptors, and signaling molecules – by these methods is essential. Here, we describe a substantially improved massively-parallel scRNA-Seq protocol we term Seq-Well S^3 (“Second-Strand Synthesis”) that increases the efficiency of transcript capture and gene detection by up to 10- and 5-fold, respectively, relative to previous iterations, surpassing best-in-class commercial analogs. We first characterized the performance of Seq-Well S^3 in cell lines and PBMCs, and then examined five different inflammatory skin diseases, illustrative of distinct types of inflammation, to explore the breadth of potential immune and parenchymal cell states. Our work presents an essential methodological advance as well as a valuable resource for studying the cellular and molecular features that inform human skin inflammation.","We characterized the glial cells in the Drosophila third instar brain using single cell RNA-seq and compared a Ama knockdown glia to the control. The results identified defects in surface glia, an increase in infiltrating hemocytes, and a novel Ama knockdown cluster defined by sty.","This study investigates how master splicing regulators interact and the extent to which transcription regulators are spliced differently during brain development. Cell-type-specific RNA-Seq analyses of the developing neocortex uncover variable expression of the Rbfox1/2/3 genes and enriched splicing events in transcription regulators, altering protein isoforms or inducing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Transient expression of Rbfox proteins in radial glial progenitors induces neuronal splicing events preferentially in transcription regulators such as Meis2 and Tead1. Surprisingly, Rbfox proteins promote the inclusion of a mammal-specific alternative exon and a previously undescribed poison exon in Ptbp1. Simultaneous ablation of Rbfox1/2/3 in the neocortex downregulates neuronal isoforms and disrupts radial neuronal migration. Furthermore, the progenitor isoform of Meis2 promotes Tgfb3 transcription, while the Meis2 neuron isoform promotes neuronal differentiation. These observations indicate that transcription regulators are differentially spliced between cell types in the developing neocortex.","Nogo-A is a major regulator of neural development and regeneration in the central nervous system, but its role in tooth innervation remains largely unknown. Neurons of the trigeminal ganglion innervate the teeth. We showed that Nogo-A is expressed in the trigeminal ganglion and tooth-related nerve fibres. Nogo-A deletion in mice leads to a less complex neuronal network when compared to wild-type animals. Bulk RNA sequencing on the trigeminal ganglia of Nogo-A KO and wild-type mice revealed gene expression changes associated with alterations in neurotrophin signalling and neuronal synaptic formation during the development and maturation of the trigeminal neurons.","GABAB receptor (GABABR) activation is known to alleviate pain by reducing neuronal excitability, primarily through inhibition of high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium (CaV2.2) channels and potentiating G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. While the analgesic properties of small molecules and peptides have been primarily tested on isolated murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, emerging strategies to develop, study, and characterise human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived sensory neurons present a promising alternative. In this study, hPSCs were efficiently differentiated into peripheral DRG-induced sensory neurons (iSNs) using a combined chemical and transcription factor-driven approach, via a neural crest cell intermediate. Molecular characterisation and transcriptomic analysis confirmed the expression of key DRG markers such as BRN3A, ISLET1, and PRPH, in addition to GABABR and ion channels including CaV2.2 and GIRK1 in iSNs. Functional characterisation of GABABR was conducted using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, assessing neuronal excitability under current clamp conditions in the absence and presence of GABABR agonists baclofen and α-conotoxin Vc1.1. Both baclofen (100 mM) and Vc1.1 (1 mM) significantly reduced membrane excitability by hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential, and increasing the rheobase for action potential firing. In voltage-clamp mode, baclofen and Vc1.1 inhibited HVA Ca2+ channel currents, which were attenuated by the selective GABABR antagonist CGP 55845. However, modulation of GIRK channels by GABABRs was not observed in the presence of baclofen or Vc1.1, suggesting that functional GIRK1/2 channels were not coupled to GABABRs in hPSC-derived iSNs. This study reports is the first to report GABABR modulation of membrane excitability in iSNs by baclofen and Vc1.1, highlighting their potential as a future model for studying analgesic compounds.","After the data quality control, a total of 15,094 captured cells were subjected to clustering analysis by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) strategy. The results showed that there could be clustered into 20 distinct cell clusters. According to the highest differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and canonical markers used in prior studies, we annotated these 20 clusters as 10 major cell types with distinct expression profiles): astrocytes (ASC, containing 2 clusters: ASC_1 and ASC_2), microglia (MG, containing 2 clusters: MG_1 and MG_2), oligodendrocytes (containing 4 clusters), endothelial cells (containing 2 clusters), pericytes, fibroblasts, neuronal cells (NEU, containing 4 clusters: NEU_1 to NEU _4), ependymal cells(containing 4 clusters), blood cells and immune cells.","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic determinant. A major hypothesis to explain disease aetiology comprises synaptic dysfunction associated with excitatory-inhibitory imbalance of synaptic transmission, ultimately contributing to impaired network oscillation and cognitive deficits associated with the disease. Here, we studied the morphological and functional properties of a highly defined co-culture of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from patients with idiopathic SCZ. Our results indicate upregulation of synaptic genes and increased excitatory synapse formation on GABAergic neurons in co-cultures. In parallel, we observed decreased lengths of axon initial segments, concordant with data from postmortem brains from patients with SCZ. Patch-clamp analyses revealed differential processing of excitatory input with markedly increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) recorded from GABAergic SCZ neurons and decreased spontaneous EPSC from glutamatergic SCZ neurons. Likewise, we observed decreased amplitudes of calcium signals selectively in GABAergic neurons while frequency was increased in both neuronal populations. Finally, MEA recordings from neuronal networks indicate increased synchronization of network activity. In conclusion, our results suggest selective deregulation of neuronal activity and synaptic transmission in SCZ samples, providing evidence for differential signal processing in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons as a potential base for aberrant network synchronization.","The Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease risk locus Fyn kinase is implicated in protein pathophysiology and NF-κB microglia inflammatory signaling. To investigate in vivo mechanisms of Fyn driven neurodegeneration, we built a zebrafish neural specific Gal4:UAS model of constitutively active FynY531F signaling. Using in vivo live imaging we demonstrate neural FynY531F expression leads to dopaminergic neuron loss and mitochondrial aggregation in 5 day larval brain. Gene expression analyses reveal reduction in neuroprotective genes, and elevated inflammatory cytokines Il-1β, IL-12 and TNF-α and genes associated with oxidative stress. These phenotypes correlate with microglia activation in the larval brain. Chemical inhibition demonstrates dopaminergic neuron loss is dependent on Fyn and NF-κB/Caspase 1 signaling. We identify Stat3 activation as a novel downstream effector of Fyn signaling that acts synergistically with NF-κB in dopaminergic neuron degeneration. These results show Fyn drives neurodegeneration through NF-κB inflammatory signaling and Stat3 pathways. Activation of Stat3 provides a potential link from Fyn to mitochondrial dysfunction associated with dopaminergic neuron loss.","The generation of neuronal subtypes in the mammalian central nervous system is driven by competing genetic programs. The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) gives rise to two major cortical interneuron (cIN) populations, marked by Somatostatin (Sst) and Parvalbumin (Pvalb), which develop on different timelines. The extent to which external signals influence these identities remains poorly understood. Pvalb-positive cINs are particularly important for regulating cortical circuits through strong perisomatic inhibition, yet they have been difficult to model in vitro. Here we investigated the role of the environment in shaping and maintaining Pvalb cINs. We grafted mouse MGE progenitors into a variety of 2D and 3D coculture models, including mouse and human cortical, MGE, and thalamic systems with dissociated cells, organoids, organotypic cultures, and conditioned media. Across models, we observed distinct proportions of Sst- and Pvalb-positive cIN descendants. Strikingly, grafting MGE progenitors into 3D human, but not mouse, corticogenesis models led to efficient, non-autonomous differentiation of Pvalb-positive cINs. This differentiation was characterized by upregulation of Pvalb maturation markers, downregulation of Sst-specific markers, and the formation of perineuronal nets. Furthermore, lineage-traced postmitotic Sst-positive cINs, when grafted, also upregulated Pvalb expression. These results reveal an unexpected level of fate plasticity in MGE-derived cINs, demonstrating that their identities can be dynamically shaped by the surrounding environment.","Dopamine (DA) signaling plays an essential role in reward valence attribution and in encoding the reinforcing properties of natural and artificial rewards. The adaptive responses from midbrain dopamine neurons to artificial rewards such as drugs of abuse are therefore important for understanding the development of substance use disorders. Drug-induced changes in gene expression are one such adaptation that can determine the activity of dopamine signaling in projection regions of the brain reward system. One of the major challenges to obtaining this understanding is the inherent cellular heterogeneity in the brain, where each neuron population can be defined by a distinct transcriptional profile. To bridge this gap, we have adapted a virus-based method for labeling and capture of dopamine nuclei, coupled with nuclear RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, to study the transcriptional adaptations, specifically, of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) during cocaine taking and cocaine craving, using a mouse model of cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA). Our results show significant changes in gene expression across non-drug operant training, cocaine taking, and cocaine craving, highlighted by an enrichment in expression of repressive epigenetic modifying enzymes during cocaine craving. Immunohistochemical validation further revealed an increase of H3K9me3 deposition in DA neurons during cocaine craving. These results demonstrate that cocaine-induced transcriptional adaptations in dopamine neurons vary by phase of self-administration and suggest that such an approach may be useful in identifying relevant phase-specific molecular targets to alter the behavioral course of substance use disorders.","Paired-class homeodomain transcription factors (HD TFs) play essential roles in vertebrate development, and their mutations are linked to human diseases. One unique feature of paired-class HD is cooperative dimerization on specific palindrome DNA sequences. Yet, the functional significance of HD cooperative dimerization in animal development and its dysregulation in diseases remain elusive. Using the retinal TF Cone-rod Homeobox (CRX) as a model, we have studied how blindness-causing mutations in the paired HD, p.E80A and p.K88N, alter CRX’s cooperative dimerization, lead to gene misexpression and photoreceptor developmental deficits in dominant manners. CRXE80A maintains binding at monomeric WT CRX motifs but is deficient in cooperative binding at dimeric motifs. CRXE80A’s dimerization defect impacts the exponential increase of photoreceptor gene expression in terminal differentiation and produces immature, non-functional photoreceptors in the CrxE80A retinas. CRXK88N is highly cooperative and localizes to ectopic genomic sites with strong enrichment of dimeric HD motifs. CRXK88N’s altered biochemical properties disrupt CRX’s ability to direct dynamic chromatin remodeling during development to activate photoreceptor differentiation programs and silence progenitor programs. Our study here provides in vitro and in vivo molecular evidence that paired-class HD cooperative dimerization regulates neuronal development and dysregulation of cooperative binding contributes to severe dominant blinding retinopathies.","The neurons of the melanocortin system regulate feeding and energy homeostasis through a combination of electrical and endocrine mechanisms. However, the molecular basis for this functional heterogeneity are poorly understood. Here, a voltage-gated potassium (K+) channel named KCNB1 (alias Kv2.1), formed stable complexes with the leptin receptor (LepR) in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expressing neurons of the Arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARCPOMC). Mice lacking functional KCNB1 channels (NULL mice), exhibited constitutive depolarization of ARCPOMC neurons along with aberrant POMC production. In NULL neurons, canonical LepR-STAT3 signaling--which underlies POMC production--was impaired, whereas non-canonical insulin receptor substrate PI3K/Akt/FOXO1 and ERK signaling were significantly upregulated. Accordingly, the NULL animals were insensitive to anorexic stimuli induced by leptin administration and produced less adipose tissue and circulating leptin than WT animals. Taken together, these findings unveil an exquisite mechanism of metabolic regulation whereby synergistic control of neuronal excitability and endocrine function is achieved through the partnership between a K+ channel and a hormone receptor. As aberrant KCNB1 channels cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, these results further establish a K+ channel as a causative link between epileptic and metabolic disorders.","The most common genetic cause of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a G4C2 repeat expansion in intron 1 of the C9orf72 gene. This repeat expansion undergoes bidirectional transcription to produce sense and antisense repeat RNA species. Both sense and antisense-derived repeat RNAs undergo repeat-associated non-AUG translation in all reading frames to generate five distinct dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Importantly, toxicity has been associated with both sense and antisense repeat-derived RNA and DPRs. This suggests targeting both sense and antisense repeat RNA may provide the most effective therapeutic strategy. The RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 systems offer a promising avenue for simultaneous targeting of multiple RNA transcripts, as they mature their own guide arrays, thus allowing targeting of more than one RNA species from a single construct. We show that CRISPR-Cas13d originating from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) can successfully reduce C9orf72 sense and antisense repeat transcripts and DPRs to background levels in HEK cells overexpressing C9orf72 repeats. CRISPR-CasRx also markedly reduced the endogenous sense and antisense repeat RNAs and DPRs in three independent C9orf72 patient-derived iPSC-neuron lines, without detectable off-target effects. To determine whether CRISPR-CasRx is effective in vivo, we treated two distinct C9orf72 repeat mouse models using AAV delivery and observed a significant reduction in both sense and antisense repeat-containing transcripts. Taken together this work highlights the potential for RNA-targeting CRISPR systems as therapeutics for C9orf72 ALS/FTD.","The goals of this study is to compare transcriptome profiles (RNA-seq) of seven 5-HT neuronal subpopulations in zebrafish whole brain. Tg(tph2:GFP) fish at 7 dpf were fixed in a recording chamber containing extracellular solution. The somata of 5-HT neurons from seven subpopulations (PT, SR-R, SR-M, SR-C, IR-R, IR-C, MO) were visualized under a fluorescence microscopy, then targeted and collected separately using glass electrode. For each sample, 10-12 neurons were collected and transferred to lysis buffer solution. Total RNA was extracted for construction of cDNA libraries, involving fragmentation, PCR enrichment, N7 index linking, and purification. A total of 71 QuantSeq libraries (N=9-12 samples for each subpopulation) were prepared using the Lexogen’s QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was carried out using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with 150 bp paired-end reads. Gene expression level analysis was performed using R (Version 4.3.1) package Seurat (Version 5.0.2), and the mean gene expression matrix of all samples was obtained after processing by NormalizeData function. For marker gene analysis of each subpopulation, FindAllMarkers function in Seurat was used, with parameters set as min.pct=0.1 and logfc.threshold=0.25. Differential expression analysis revealed that each subpopulation expressed a set of featured genes, including specific markers for neurotransmitters, axon projection, neuron development, synapse, and ion channels, suggesting that seven 5-HT neuronal subpopulations display distinct genetic profiles.  We demonstrated that seven 5-HT neuronal subpopulations are molecularly discriminative by expressing distinct molecular markers.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of late-life dementia characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and brain deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau. The APOE ε2 encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE2) is a protective allele against AD among the three genotypes (APOE ε2, ε3, ε4), while APOE4 is the strongest genetic factor substantially increasing AD risk. APOE regulates brain lipid homeostasis and maintaining synaptic plasticity and neuronal function, where APOE2 has a superior function compared to APOE3 and APOE4. Gene therapy that increases APOE2 levels in the brain is, therefore, a promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. We previously reported that PEGylated liposomes conjugated with transferrin and a cell-penetrating peptide Penetratin sufficiently deliver chitosan-APOE2 cDNA plasmid complex into the brain of wild-type mice. Here, we investigated how brain-targeting liposome-based APOE2 gene delivery influences Aβ)-related pathologies in amyloid model AppNL-G-F knockin mice at 12-month-old. We found a trend of reductions of insoluble Aβ levels in the mouse cortices 1 month after APOE2 gene therapy. Furthermore, in the AppNL-G-F knockin mice that received the APOE2 gene therapy, brain transcriptome analysis through RNA-sequencing identified the upregulation of genes/pathways related to neuronal development. This was supported by increases of Dlg4 and Syp mRNAs coding synaptic proteins in the experimental group. On the other hand, we found that APOE2 gene delivery increased soluble Aβ levels, including oligomers, as well as exacerbated neurite dystrophy and decreased synaptophysin. Together, our results suggest that brain-targeting liposome-based APOE2 gene therapy is potentially beneficial for synaptic formation at the transcriptional level. Forced APOE2 expressions, however, may exacerbate Aβ toxicity by increasing the dissociation of Aβ oligomers from aggregates in the presence of considerable amyloid burden.","Frailty is a geriatric multi-dimensional syndrome which reflects multisystem physiological change and is a transversal measure of reduced resilience to negative events. It is characterized by weakness, frequent falls, cognitive decline, increased hospitalization and dead, and represents a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The fact that frailty is recognized as a reversible condition, encourages the identification of earlier biomarkers to timely predict and prevent its occurrence. SAMP8 (Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone-8) mice represent the most appropriate preclinical model to this aim and were used in this study to carry transcriptional and metabolic analyses in the brain and plasma respectively, upon a characterization at cognitive, motor, structural and neuropathological level at 2.5, 6 and 9 months of age. At 2.5 months SAMP8 mice started displaying memory deficits, muscle weakness and motor impairment. Functional alterations were associated with a neurodevelopment deficiency associated with reduced neuronal density and glial cell loss. Through transcriptomics we identified specific genetic signatures well distinguishing SAMP8 mice at 6 months and correlating with motor and cognitive dysfunction, whereas plasma metabolomics allowed to segregate SAMP8 mice from SAMR1 already at 2.5 months of age by detecting constitutively lower levels of acylcarnitines and lipids in SAMP8 at all ages investigated. Our findings suggest that specific genetic alterations at central level, as well as metabolomic changes in plasma, might allow to early assess a frail condition leading to dementia development, which paves the foundation for future investigation in a clinical setting.","The amniote pallium, a vital component of the forebrain, has undergone considerable evolutionary divergence across species and is critical for a variety of functions including sensation, memory and learning. The relationship between pallial subregions in different species remain elusive, particularly regarding the identification of homologous neurons and their similar or distinct signatures. Here, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing to examine over 130,000 nuclei from macaque (Macaca fascicularis) neocortex, alongside datasets from human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), zebra finch(Taeniopygia guttata), turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii), and lizard (Pogona vitticeps), for a cross-species comparison.","The innate immune system plays essential roles in brain development, including the remodeling of neuronal synapses. Innate lymphocytes are the most recently discovered member of the innate immune arsenal, whose developmental expansion and activation make them potential mediators of brain-immune communication during synapse formation. Here we show that group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and their cytokine Interleukin-13 (IL-13) signal directly to inhibitory interneurons to increase inhibitory synapse density in the developing brain. ILC2s expanded and produced IL-13 in the developing brain meninges. Loss of ILC2s or IL-13 signaling to interneurons decreased inhibitory, but not excitatory, cortical synapses. Conversely, ILC2s and IL-13 were sufficient to increase inhibitory synapses. Loss of this signaling pathway led to selective impairments in social interaction. These data define a type 2 neuroimmune circuit in early life that shapes inhibitory synapse development and behavior.","Obesity is a global pandemic and a key risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, or dementia. The neurovascular unit (NVU), essential for blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and comprised of endothelial cells, glial cells (microglia and astrocytes), and neurons, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of obesity on endothelial and other cells of and its contribution to neurodegeneration remains largely unknown. In this study we aimed to decipher in-dept molecular modifications induced by obesity in cells of neurovascular unit by integrative multiomics analysis of endothelial cells, neurons, microglial cells, and astrocytes from the hippocampus of ob/ob mice. Hippocampus were isolated from ob/ob and C57BL/6J male mice at 17-18 weeks of age. Gene expression profiles of cells of hippocampus were obtained using single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) and data analyzed using in-dept bioinformatic analyses. snRNAseq and UMAP analysis revealed 19 cell types in hippocampus. Comparisons of global gene expression profiles identified different global profiles between ob/ob and WT for each of the cell types of the NVU. Statistical analyses revealed 4463 DEGs in neuronal cells, 1386 DEGs in astrocytes, 125DEGs in endothelial cells, and 155 DEGs in microglia cells, suggesting that obesity significantly impacts the expression profiles of NUV cells. Enrichment analyses revealed that these genes are involved in cellular processing like focal adhesion, cell interactions, inflammation, and metabolism. Changes in the expression in endothelial cells were positively correlated with genomic changes in other cell types, changes that we correlated with tendency in increase in BBB observed using functional MRI. Taken together, obesity exert significant cell-specific changes in global gene expression, genes that are associated with development of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.","Elastic fibers are required for expansion and recoil during contraction and relaxation of vessels and heart valves. The aortic valve (AoV) extracellular matrix is generated and maintained by valvular interstitial cells (VICs), a heterogeneous population of cells derived from a mixture of developmental precursors such as endocardium, neural crest and second heart field. Although most studies have focused on VICs that exhibit a fibroblastic phenotype, significant subpopulations present with neuronal, glial, smooth muscle and melanocytic phenotypes. Relatively little is known about which sub population of VICs regulate and produce elastic fibers, though elastin (Eln) abnormalities result in congenital AoV defects and Eln degradation initiates AoV diseases. The present study establishes the timing ofElnexpression in the murine AoV. We performed RT-qPCR and found thatElnpeaks at late embryogenesis (embryonic day 17.5) and early postnatal (P) stages and decreases to low levels in adulthood. Using spatial transcriptomics in postnatal day 3 AoV, we segregated AoV cells from other cardiac cells and demonstrated thatElnexpression correlates with that of genes known to regulate elastogenesis, including the common smooth muscle cell marker - Acta2. By combining RNAscopein situhybridization with immunofluorescence, we confirmed that VICs that expressElnco-express alpha smooth muscle actin. Additionally, some of theEln/alpha smooth muscle actin expressing cells also express melanocytic markers. As previously reported in adult mice, we show a relationship between AoV pigment and elastic fiber patterning during early postnatal stages and further show that melanocytes may play a critical role in elastogenesis. Our results indicate that in the murine AoVElnis produced during early postnatal stages by cells that co-express phenotypic markers of various cell types, including smooth muscle actin and melanocytic specific genes.","The molecular mechanism underlying the role of hippocampal hilar interneuron degeneration in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remains unclear. Especially, very few studies have focused on the role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, encoded by Nos1) containing hilar interneurons in TLE. In the present study, Nos1 conditional knockout mice were constructed, and we found that selective deletion of Nos1 in hilar interneurons rather than dentate granular cells (DGCs) triggered epileptogenesis. The level of nNOS was downregulated in patients and mice with TLE. Nos1 deletion led to excessive epilepsy-like excitatory input circuit formation and hyperexcitation of DGCs. Replenishment of hilar nNOS protein blocked epileptogenic development and memory impairment in pilocarpine-induced TLE mice. Moreover, chronic treatment with DETA/NONOate, a slowly released exogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor, prevented aberrant neural circuits of DGCs and the consequent epileptogenesis without acute antiseizure effects. Therefore, we concluded that NO donor therapy may be a novel anti-epileptogenesis strategy, different from existing antiseizure medications (ASMs), for curing TLE.","In this study, we isolated RNA from the whole blood of 19 patients who developed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also isolated RNA from the whole blood of 17 healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed the genes that had differential expression between patients with ME/CFS and HCs.","We investigated the role of PME-1 (protein phosphatase methylesterase-1) as a specific methylesterase for the critical cancer suppressor, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and its potential contributions to the development and malignancy of various cancers. Notably, no gene expression database related to PME-1 deficiency had been previously reported. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an analysis of the impact of PME-1 on gene expression using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from both PME-1 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice.","Natural mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation plays a fundamental role in human disease and enables the clonal tracing of native human cells. While various genotyping approaches revealed mutational heterogeneity in human tissues and single cells, current methodologies are limited by scale. Here, we introduce a high-throughput, droplet-based mitochondrial single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (mtscATAC-seq) protocol and computational framework that facilitate high-confidence mtDNA mutation calling in thousands of single cells. Further, the concomitant high-quality accessible chromatin readout enables the paired inference of individual cell mtDNA heteroplasmy, clonal lineage, cell state, and accessible chromatin regulatory features. Our multi-omic analyses reveals single-cell variation in heteroplasmy of a pathologic mtDNA variant (m.8344A&gt;G), which we tie to intra-individual chromatin variability and clonal evolution. Further, using somatic mtDNA mutations, we clonally trace thousands of hematopoietic cells in vitro and in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, linking epigenomic variability to subclonal evolution in vivo. ","We identified a novel N1-methyladenosine (m1A) modification in tRNALys with distinct effects on the synthesis and stabilities of the 13 mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, we observed regulated RNA modifications of mitochondrial tRNAs for the control of mitochondrial gene expression. Collectively, our data provide unprecedented insight into the regulation of mitochondrial tRNAs and reveal greater complexity to the molecular pathogenesis of MERRF.","MicroRNA-223, a principal myeloid-specific anti-inflammatory microRNA, is dysregulated in numerous inflammatory conditions and cancers. We found that miR-223 deficient zebrafish displayed augmented neutrophilic inflammation, which was due primarily to elevated activation of the canonical NF-B pathway. To our surprise, the NF-B over-activation was restricted to the basal epithelial cells, a squamous layer permeable to oxygen and chemicals. MiR-223 was expressed in epithelial cells and directly down-regulated multiple components in the NF-B signaling pathway in zebrafish and human. Both phagocytic and epithelial miR-223 suppressed neutrophil wound response and NF-B activation in the basal epithelial cells. Together, our data provide the mechanism of the multifaceted role of miR-223 and highlight the previously overlooked relevance of epithelial cells in miR-223 related diseases.","Cystain B (Cstb) is a ubiquitously expressed cysteine protease inhibitor and mutations of the CSTB gene lead to the neurodegenerative disease progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundorg type (EPM1). We are interested in the microglia-specific, Cstb-dependent gene-expression changes in mice and in this data set, we include gene-level expression data from cultured primary microglia of control and Cstb-/- mice extracted from neonatal mice at P5 and we identified 156 differentially-expressed genes in Cstb-/- microglia.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Methanol (MeOH) is considered to be a poison in humans because of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-mediated conversion of MeOH into toxic formaldehyde (FA). Our recent genome-wide analysis of the mouse brain demonstrated that an increase in endogenous MeOH after ADH inhibition led to a significant increase in the plasma MeOH concentration and the modification of mRNA synthesis. These findings suggest endogenous MeOH involvement in homeostasis regulation by controlling mRNA levels. Here, we demonstrate directly that study volunteers displayed increasing concentrations of MeOH and FA in their blood plasma when consuming citrus pectin, ethanol and red wine. A microarray analysis of white blood cells (WBC) in volunteers after pectin intake showed various responses for 30 differentially regulated mRNAs. Most of the mRNAs were somehow involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There was also a decreased synthesis of hemoglobin  mRNA, HBA and HBB, the presence of which in WBC RNA was not a result of red blood cells contamination because erythrocyte-specific marker genes did not show significant change. A qRT-PCR analysis of volunteer WBC after pectin and red wine intake confirmed the complicated dependence between plasma MeOH content and the mRNA accumulation of previously identified genes, namely GAPDH and SNX27, and MME, SORL1, DDIT4, HBA and HBB genes revealed in this study. We hypothesized that human plasma MeOH, which is replenished from endogenous and exogenous sources (diet), has an impact on the WBC mRNA levels of genes involved in AD pathogenesis and signaling.","Methanol (MeOH) is considered to be a poison in humans because of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-mediated conversion of MeOH into toxic formaldehyde (FA).

In an approach towards understanding the molecular basis of pathogenic events in EPM1 we have utilized the cystatin B  deficient mice (Cstb-/-), a model for the disease. We have characterized the gene expression changes from the cerebellum of Cstb-/- mouse at postnatal day 7 (P7) and P30 as well as in cultured cerebellar granule cells using a pathway-based approach. A marked upregulation of immune response genes was seen at P30, reflecting the ongoing neuropathology, however, the observed alterations in complement cascade genes could also imply defects in synaptic plasticity. Differentially expressed genes in pre-symptomatic Cstb-/- animals at P7 were connected to synaptic function and plasticity and in cultured cerebellar granule cells to cellular biogenesis, cytoskeleton and intracellular transport. Especially GABAergic pathways were affected.","Analysis of granule cells dissected from postnatal day 5 cystatin B (CSTB)-deficient mice and cultured for 2 days. Progressive myoclonus epilepsy Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by CSTB gene mutations. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of EPM1.","Analysis of cerebella from symptomatic, postnatal day 30 cystatin B (CSTB)-deficient mice.

Results provide insight into the molecular basis of EPM1 pathogenesis.","Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA) is a human polyQ disease caused by the expansion of a CAG strech in the atrophin-1 (at-1) gene. In all vertebrates, a second atrophin gene (at-2) is present and it encodes a related protein void of polyQ tracks. In D.melanogaster there is one conserved Atrophin (Atro) gene, ubiquitously expressed, which contains all functional domains of vertebrate Atrophins, including two polyQ stretches. To understand to what extent transcriptional alterations cause neurodegeneration and are linked to the normal functions of Atrophin, we performed a genome wide transcriptional profiling in our Drosophila models, focusing on primary events that precede neurodegeneration. We have found that polyQ Atro downregulates fat, which protects from neurodegeneration and Atrophin toxicity trhough the Hippo kinase cascade.","During senescence of detached rice leaves, tryptophan (Trp) and Trp-derived secondary metabolites such as serotonin and 4-coumaroylserotonin accumulated in concert with methanol (MeOH) production. This senescence-induced MeOH induction was closely associated with levels of pectin methylesterase (PME)1 mRNA and PME enzyme activity. Exogenous challenge of detached rice leaves with 1% MeOH accelerated Trp and serotonin biosynthesis with induction of the corresponding genes. No other solvents including ethanol resulted in a Trp-inducing effect. This MeOH-induced Trp synthesis was positively regulated by abscisic acid but negatively regulated by cytokinin, suggesting hormonal involvement on the action of MeOH. Endogenous overproduction or suppression of MeOH either by PME1 overexpression or RNAi gene silencing revealed that PME1 overexpressing lines produced twofold higher Trp levels with elevated Trp biosynthetic gene expression, whereas RNAi lines showed twofold reduction in Trp level in healthy control rice leaves, suggesting that MeOH acts as an endogenous elicitor to enhance Trp biosynthesis. Among many transcription factors induced following MeOH treatment, the WRKY family showed significant induction patterns of which WRKY14 appeared to play a key regulatory role in MeOH-induced Trp and Trp-derived secondary metabolite biosynthesis.","Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html  June 03, 2009: annotation table updated with netaffx build 28 June 07, 2012: annotation table updated with netaffx build 32 June 23, 2016: annotation table updated with netaffx build 35 Protocol: see manufacturer's web site  All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 are included on the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.

Here we identify MYLIP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase thought to specifically target lipoprotein receptors, as a negative regulator of HIF-1α/2α. MYLIP interacts with HIF-1α/2α and catalyzes K27-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 118/442 (HIF-1α) or lysine 117 (HIF-2α). This modification induces proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α, resulting in inhibition of hypoxia signaling. Furthermore, Mylip-deficient bluntsnout bream, zebrafish and mice are more tolerant to hypoxia. These findings reveal a role for MYLIP in regulating hypoxia signaling and identify a target for developing fish strains with high hypoxia tolerance for the benefit of the","Dyrk1A deficiency is linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delays, intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Haploinsufficiency of Dyrk1a in mice reportedly leads to ASD-related phenotypes. However, the key pathological mechanisms remain unclear and human DYRK1A mutations remain uncharacterized in mice. Here, we generated and studied Dyrk1a-knockin mice carrying a human ASD patient mutation (Ile48LysfsX2; Dyrk1a-I48K mice). These mice display severe microcephaly, social and cognitive deficits, dendritic shrinkage, excitatory synaptic deficits, and altered phospho-proteomic patterns enriched for multiple signaling pathways and synaptic proteins.","The tongue facilitates vital activities such as swallowing. Swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) are common in the elderly and in many adult-onset neuromuscular diseases. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), dysphagia is often the first symptom. OPMD is an autosomal dominant myopathy caused by a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the gene encoding PABPN1. The expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble nuclear aggregates that reduce the levels of the soluble form. Clinical tongue involvement in OPMD has been documented but is poorly understood. Tongue histopathology was investigated in OPMD mouse models using light and electron microscopy. Muscle histopathology was predominantly affected by age. PABPN1 nuclear aggregates were found at moderate levels, whereas deposition of insoluble PABPN1 in blood vessels was already prominent in 4-month-old mice. RNA signatures of the OPMD tongue were enriched for mitochondrial and cytoskeletal genes, suggesting an energy and contractile deficit.  ","To investigate SLC7A11 inhibition-induced ferroptosis in LDHB-deficient lung cancer cells requires glutaminolysis","The integrity of the blood–retina barrier (BRB) is crucial for phototransduction and vision, by tightly restricting transport of molecules between the blood and surrounding neuronal cells. Breakdown of the BRB leads to the development of retinal diseases. Here, we show that Netrin-1/Unc5b and Norrin/Lrp5 signaling establish a zonated endothelial cell gene expression program that controls BRB integrity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of postnatal BRB-competent mouse retina endothelial cells (ECs), we investigate &gt;100 BRB genes encoding Wnt signaling components, tight junction proteins, and ion and nutrient transporters. We find that BRB gene expression is zonated across arteries, capillaries, and veins and regulated by opposing gradients of the Netrin-1 receptor Unc5b and Lrp5-β-catenin signaling between retinal arterioles and venules. Mice deficient for Ntn1 or Unc5b display more BRB leakage at the arterial end of the vasculature, while Lrp5 loss of function causes predominantly venular BRB leakage. ScRNA-seq of Ntn1 and Unc5b mutant ECs reveals down-regulated β-catenin signaling and  BRB gene expression that is rescued by Ctnnb1 overactivation, along with BRB integrity. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 and Norrin additively enhance β-catenin transcriptional activity and Lrp5 phosphorylation via the Discs large homologue 1 (Dlg1) scaffolding protein, and endothelial Lrp5-Unc5b function converges in protection of capillary BRB integrity. These findings explain how arteriovenous zonation is established and maintained in the BRB and reveal that BRB gene expression is regulated at the level of endothelial subtypes.","T cell activation is accompanied by extensive changes in epigenome. However, whether and how high-ordered chromatin organization is involved in CD8+ T cell activation is unclear. Here, we showed extensive changes in the three-dimensional genome during CD8+ T cell activation, associated with changes in gene transcription. Moreover, we identified Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) as an essential mediator in re-organization of spatial chromosomal interactions. Trim28 deficiency impaired CD8+ T cell activation in vitro and in vivo, due to its regulation on autocrine IL-2 production. Mechanistically, TRIM28 bound to genes associated with CD8+ T cell activation and promoted the formation of chromosomal loops. At the loop anchor regions, TRIM28 is likely recruited by CTCF, and required for binding of RNA Pol II and cohesin to form active chromosomal structure. These results thus identify a critical role of TRIM28-dependent chromatin topology in gene transcription during CD8+ T cell activation.","T cell activation is accompanied by extensive changes in epigenome.

Here, we showed extensive changes in the three-dimensional genome during CD8+ T cell activation, associated with changes in gene transcription. Moreover, we identified Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) as an essential mediator in re-organization of spatial chromosomal interactions. Trim28 deficiency impaired CD8+ T cell activation in vitro and in vivo, due to its regulation on autocrine IL-2 production. Mechanistically, TRIM28 bound to genes associated with CD8+ T cell activation and promoted the formation of chromosomal loops. At the loop anchor regions, TRIM28 is likely recruited by CTCF, and required for binding of RNA Pol II and cohesin to form active chromosomal structure. These results thus identify a critical role of TRIM28-dependent chromatin topology in gene transcription during CD8+ T cell activation.","T cell activation is accompanied by extensive changes in epigenome.

The pathophysiology of lung I/R injury involves ferroptosis and elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, while the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on lung I/R injury remains unclear. This research aimed to explore the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on reducing ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells caused by I/R.  First, we identified O-GlcNAc transferase 1 (Ogt1) as a differentially expressed gene in lung epithelial cells of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) patients, using single-cell sequencing, and Gene Ontology analysis (GO analysis) revealed the enrichment of the ferroptosis process. We found a time-dependent dynamic alteration in lung O-GlcNAcylation during I/R injury. Proteomics analysis identified the differentially expressed proteins enriched in ferroptosis and multiple redox-related pathways based on KEGG annotation. Thus, we generated Ogt1-conditional knockout mice and found that Ogt1 deficiency aggravated ferroptosis, as evidenced by lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), Fe2+, as well as alterations in critical protein expression glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Consistently, we found that elevated O-GlcNAcylation inhibited ferroptosis sensitivity in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury-induced TC-1 cells via O-GlcNAcylated NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, both the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that Nrf2 could bind with translation start site (TSS) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and promote its transcriptional activity. As an important rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), elevated G6PDH provided a mass of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to improve the redox state of glutathione (GSH) and eventually led to ferroptosis resistance. Rescue experiments proved that Nrf2 knockdown or Nrf2-T334A (O-GlcNAcylation site) mutation abolished the protective effect of ferroptosis resistance.  In summary, we revealed that O-GlcNAcylation could protect against I/R lung injury by reducing ferroptosis sensitivity via the Nrf2/G6PDH pathway. Our work will provide a new basis for clinical therapeutic strategies for pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute lung injury.","Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally.  Newly metastasising cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours.  There is interest in exploiting this vulnerability to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis.  Here, we show that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, including with aspirin, enhances immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelet TXA2 triggers an immunosuppressive pathway within T cells dependent upon the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor (TCR)-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases.  Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or through platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner dependent upon T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo.  These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway limiting T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing a mechanistic basis for the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.","Airway macrophages (AMs) are critical for resolving inflammation and repairing injured lung tissue, but can also contribute to the development of fibrosis.  AMs were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of Siglec-F KO and WT mice prior to and 7, 14, and 21 days after bleomycin challenge (single dose, 2.5 units/kg, IT).  RNA was isolated using the Qiagen micro plus RNA kit and 200 ng of total RNA was used to generate RNA-Seq libraries.  The libraries were run on the NovaSeq 6000 with 80 million pair-end reads per sample.","Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), characterized by chronic tissue inflammation and fibrosis involving multiple organs, remains a major complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an anti-inflammatory drug approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. We previously reported that DMF effectively inhibits acute GVHD (aGVHD) while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, the role of DMF in cGVHD progression remains unknown. Here, we found that DMF administration significantly suppresses follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation, germinal center formation and alleviates disease severity in different murine cGVHD models. Mechanistically, DMF treatment downregulates IL-21 transcription by activation of Nrf2, thus orchestrating Tfh-related gene program both in mice and humans. The inhibitory role of DMF on Tfh cell differentiation was diminished in Nrf2 deficient T cells. Importantly, the therapeutic potential of DMF in clinical cGVHD has been validated in human data whereby DMF effectively reduces IL-21 production and Tfh cell generation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from active cGVHD patients and further attenuates xenograft GVHD. Collectively, our findings reveal that DMF potently inhibits cGVHD development by repressing Tfh cell differentiation via Nrf2, paving way for the treatment of cGVHD in the clinic.","Following DNA replication, the newly reassembled chromatin is disorganized and must mature to its steady state to maintain both genome and epigenome integrity. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this critical process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac), a mark on newly-synthesized H3, facilitates the remodeling of disorganized nucleosomes in nascent chromatin, and its removal at the subsequent G2/M phase of the cell cycle marks the completion of chromatin maturation. In vitro, H3K56ac enhances the activity of ISWI chromatin remodelers, including yeast ISW1 and its human equivalent SNF2h. In vivo, a deficiency of H3K56ac in nascent chromatin results in the formation of closely packed di-nucleosomes and/or tetra-nucleosomes. In contrast, abnormally high H3K56ac levels disrupt chromatin maturation, leading to genome instability. These findings establish a central role of H3K56ac in chromatin maturation and reveal a mechanism regulating this critical aspect of chromosome replication.","The H3K9me3-specific histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is critical for proper regulation of developmental processes, but the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. Here, we show that deletion of Setdb1 in mouse fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in compromised stem cell function, enhanced myeloerythroid differentiation, and impaired lymphoid development. Notably, Setdb1-deficient HSPCs exhibit reduced quiescence and increased proliferation, accompanied by the acquisition of a lineage-biased transcriptional program. In Setdb1-deficient HSPCs, we identify genomic regions that are characterized by loss of H3K9me3 and increased chromatin accessibility, suggesting enhanced transcription factor (TF) activity. Interestingly, hematopoietic TFs like PU.1 bind these cryptic enhancers in wild-type HSPCs, despite the H3K9me3 status. Thus, our data indicate that SETDB1 restricts activation of nonphysiological TF binding sites which helps to ensure proper maintenance and differentiation of fetal liver HSPCs.","The H3K9me3-specific histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is critical for proper regulation of developmental processes, but the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood.

Single-cell RNAseq analysis of MHCII-mismatched heart transplants developing chronic rejection identified graft IL-33 as a stimulator of tissue repair pathways in infiltrating myeloid cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Using IL-33-deficient donor mice, it was revealed that graft fibroblast-derived IL-33 potently induced Amphiregulin (Areg) expression by recipient Treg. Areg is an epidermal growth factor secreted by multiple immune cells to shape immunomodulation and tissue repair. In particular, Areg is proposed to play a major role in Treg-mediated muscle, epithelium, and nerve repair. Assessing recipient mice with Treg-specific deletion of Areg demonstrated that this pathway surprisingly contributes to chronic rejection. Specifically, heart transplants from recipients with Areg-deficient Tregs exhibited less vasculopathy and vessel-associated fibrotic niches infiltrated by recipient T cells. Mechanistically, we show that Areg does not impact Treg suppressive function, but that IL-33 mediated Treg-secretion of Areg increases fibroblast proliferation and migration. In total, these studies identify how a dysregulated repair response involving interactions between IL-33+ fibroblasts in the allograft and recipient Treg contributes to the progression of chronic rejection.","Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency is a rare genetic disease leading to a severe developmental delay. Some MCT8 deficient patients are not as severely affected than others due to residual thyroid hormone (TH) transport. Previously, we hypothesized that these patients’ mutations destabilize the MCT8 protein, which consequently will be sent for degradation. We have already demonstrated that the chemical chaperone sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) rescues the function of these mutants by stabilizing their protein expression in an overexpressing cell system. Here we expand our previous work and used human iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMECs) as a model. We could show that NaPB rescues decreased mutant MCT8 expression and restores transport function. Furthermore, we identified MCT10 as another TH transporter that contributes to T3 uptake. The decrease in mutant protein expression could be explained by the activation of components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) machinery. Increased expression after NaPB treatment is a consequence of UPR attenuation and the stabilization of MCT8 mRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that NaPB is suitable to stabilize pathogenic missense mutations and activate transport function in a human-derived cell model opening the possibility of repurposing the FDA-approved drug NaPB for MCT8 deficiency.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Transplantation of genetically corrected hepatocytes is an attractive alternative to liver transplantation but is hampered by the low amplification potential of these cells in vitro. Here, we describe a method for generating proliferative hepatic progenitor cells (iHPC) from human hepatocytes as an expandable cell source for liver therapy. Dedifferentiation of primary hepatocytes to iHPC was achieved in less than 7 days by culturing the cells in medium with a cocktail of growth factors and small molecules. In culture, iHPC expressed a combination of endoderm hepatic progenitor and mesenchymal stem cell markers and proliferated vigorously, allowing for their expansion by at least 104 times. RNA sequencing of iHPC demonstrated that they displayed far more subtle changes in both transcriptome and transposcriptome, compared to hepatocyte-derived iPSC. Finally, transplantation of iHPC into the liver of immuno-deficient mice showed iHPC differentiation potential in vivo, without triggering detectable tumor development.","Transplantation of genetically corrected hepatocytes is an attractive alternative to liver transplantation but is hampered by the low amplification potential of these cells in vitro.

One of the main difficulties associated with cellular therapy approaches is the generation and expansion of mature autologous hepatocytes. The ability to derive patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have solved the problem of generating autologous cells but differentiation and expansion of mature hepatocytes remain a challenge. Here, we report the generation of human iPSC-derived hepatic organoid (eHEPO) culture system for producing functional hepatocytes using EpCAM-positive endodermal cells as an intermediate. eHEPOs can be produced within two weeks and expanded long-term without any lose of differentiation capacity to mature hepatocyte (&gt;12 months with passage number 25) and are resilient to freeze-thaw cycles. The hepatic identity of eHEPOs was confirmed by morphological analyses, expression of mature hepatocyte markers and in vitro functional assays. Extensive global transcriptome analyses of all intermediate stages demonstrated the stepwise differentiation iPSCs to mature hepatocytes in endoderm-derived organoids. Finally, starting form patient-specific iPSCs, we created an organoid-based model of Citrullinemia type 1, an inherited urea cycle disorder caused by mutations in the argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) enzyme. The disease-related ammonia accumulation phenotype in eHEPOs could be reversed by the overexpression of the wild type ASS1 gene which also indicated that this model is amenable to genetic manipulation.  Our results demonstrate that iPSC-derived EpCAM-positive endodermal cells are excellent cell sources to generate patient-specific hepatic organoids in a fast and efficient manner.","Citrullinemia induced hepatic progenitor cells passage 3","Citrullinemia induced hepatic progenitor cells passage 1","human primary hepatocytes from a Citrullinemia metabolic disease donor","human primary hepatocytes from a Citrullinemia metabolic disease donor","Deficiency of arginase is associated with hyperargininemia, and unlike the other disorders of the urea cycle, the major mechanism of metabolism of nitrogen in terrestrial mammals, are characteristic and prominent features that include spastic diplegia/tetraplegia, clonus, and hyperreflexia; loss of ambulation, intellectual disability and progressive neurological decline are other signs.

Co-expression network analysis suggested an abnormality with myelination, which was supported by limited existing human data. Utilizing electron microscopy, marked dysmyelination was detected in 2-week-old homozygous ARG1 knockout mice. The corticospinal tract was found to be adversely affected, supporting dysmyelination as the cause of the unique neuromuscular features and implicating oligodendrocyte impairment in a deficiency of hepatic ARG1. Following neonatal hepatic gene therapy to express ARG1, the subcortical white matter, pyramidal tract, and corticospinal tract all showed a remarkable recovery in terms of myelinated axon density and ultrastructural integrity with active wrapping of axons by nearby oligodendrocyte processes. These findings support the following conclusions: first, arginase deficiency is a leukodystrophy affecting the brain and spinal cord while sparing the peripheral nervous system; and second, neonatal AAV hepatic gene therapy can rescue the defects associated with myelinated axons, strongly implicating the functional recovery of oligodendrocytes after restoration of hepatic arginase activity. These findings support the consideration of early restoration of hepatic arginase activity in those afflicted with arginase deficiency.","The circadian clock controls a wide variety of metabolic and homeostatic processes in a number of tissues, including the kidney. However, the role of the renal circadian clocks remains largely unknown. To address this question we performed transcriptomic analysis in mice with inducible and conditional ablation of the circadian clock system in the renal tubular cells (Bmal1lox/lox/Pax8-rtTA/LC1 mice). Deep sequencing of the renal transcriptome revealed significant changes in the expression of genes related to metabolic pathways and organic anion transport. In parallel, kidneys from Bmal1lox/lox/Pax8-rtTA/LC1 mice exhibited a significant decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio suggesting an increased anaerobic glycolysis and/or decreased mitochondrial function. In-depth analysis of two selected pathways revealed (i) a significant increase in plasma urea levels correlating with increased renal arginase 2 (Arg2) activity, hyperargininemia and increase of the kidney arginine content; (ii) a significantly increased plasma creatinine concentration and reduced capacity of the kidney to secrete anionic drugs (furosemide), paralleled by a ~80% decrease in the expression levels of organic anion transporter OAT3 (SLC22a8). Collectively, these results indicate that the renal circadian clocks control a variety of metabolic/homeostatic processes at both the intra-renal and systemic levels and are involved in drug disposition.","This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.","Transplantation of genetically corrected hepatocytes is an attractive alternative to liver transplantation but is hampered by the low amplification potential of these cells in vitro.
