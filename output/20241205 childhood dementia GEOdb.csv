"GSE274721","Mus musculus","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other","Therapeutic Delivery of CCL2 Modulates Immune Response and Restores Host-microbe Homeostasis","The oral cavity is an easily accessible environment that allows for protective interventions aiming at modulating the immune response to control disease processes driven by a breakdown of host- microbe homeostasis. Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent condition in which quantitative and qualitative changes of the oral microbiota (dysbiosis) trigger non-resolving chronic inflammation, progressive bone loss and ultimately tooth loss. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of local sustained delivery of the myeloid-recruiting chemokine CCL2 in murine ligature-induced PD using clinically relevant models as a preventive, interventional or reparative therapy. Local delivery of CCL2 into the periodontium inhibited bone loss and accelerated bone gain that could be ascribed to reduced osteoclasts numbers. CCL2 treatment upregulated M2-macrophage and downregulated pro-inflammatory and pro-osteoclastic markers. Furthermore, single cell RNA sequencing indicated that CCL2 therapy reversed disease-associated transcriptomic profiles of murine gingival macrophages via inhibiting TREM-1 signaling in classically activated macrophages and inducing PKA signaling in infiltrating macrophages. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing showed mitigation of microbial dysbiosis in the periodontium that correlated with a reduction in microbial load in CCL2- treated mice. This study reveals a novel protective effect of CCL2 local delivery in PD as a model for chronic inflammatory diseases caused by a disturbance in host-microbe homeostasis.",12
"GSE222969","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Single, off-the-shelf treatment of Neuropathic Mucopolysaccharidoses with iPSC-derived microglia [bulk RNA-seq]","Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders . A subgroup of LSDs is called Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), where accumulation of glycosaminoglycans causes a progressive degenerative disorder. The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly impacted with developmental delays, neurological regression, and early mortality. Current treatments are often insufficient to fully address the clinical need. Here we report the use of microglia derived from healthy human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as a potential one-time, allogeneic off-the-shelf cell therapy for several MPS. iPSC-derived microglia, termed MG01   , are replete with wild-type levels of lysosomal enzymes and we show that MG01 can deliver the functional enzyme into four different MPS knockout cell lines via mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated endocytosis in vitro. We then show that a single administration of MG01 provides sufficient enzyme to prevent behavioral deficits in two different animal models of MPS, efficacious to at least eight months after transplantation.",5

Dysregulation in the epidermal differentiation process contributes to barrier dysfunction and is implicated in the pathology of various dermatological diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate (MPS) is used as a moisturizing agent for xerosis in AD patients. However, its mechanism of action on keratinocytes, the main constituent of the epidermis, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of MPS on keratinocytes by subjecting adult human epidermal keratinocyte (HEKa) cells and three-dimensional cultured keratinocytes to MPS treatment, followed by transcriptome analysis. The analysis revealed that MPS treatment enhances keratinocyte differentiation and suppresses proliferation. We focused on amphiregulin (AREG), a membrane protein that belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and possesses a heparin-binding domain, as a significant target of the MPS among the genes altered by MPS. It is revealed that MPS exerts an inhibitory effect directly on AREG, rather than on the EGF receptor or other members of the EGF family. Furthermore, it is suggested that AREG leads to a reduction in epidermal barrier function, whereas MPS contributes to barrier enhancement through AREG inhibition. Collectively, these findings suggest that MPS modulates barrier function through the inhibition of AREG, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for skin barrier restoration.",33
"GSE246526","Monascus purpureus","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","COMPASS core subunits MpSet1 and MpSwd3 regulate Monascus pigments synthesis in Monascus purpureus","In eukaryotes, methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me) catalyzed by the complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS) is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of genes and the development of organisms. In Monascus, the functions of COMPASS in establishing H3K4me remain unclear. This study first identified the conserved COMPASS core subunits MpSet1 and MpSwd3 in Monascus purpureus and confirmed their roles in establishing H3K4me2/3. Loss of MpSet1 and MpSwd3 resulted in slower growth and development and inhibited the formation of cleistothecia, ascospores, and conidia. The loss of these core subunits also decreased the production of extracellular and intracellular Monascus pigments (MPs) by 94.2%, 93.5%, 82.7%, and 82.5%, respectively. In addition, RNA high-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that the loss of MpSet1 and MpSwd3 altered the expression of 2646 and 2659 genes, respectively, and repressed the transcription of MPs synthesis-related genes. In addition, the ΔMpset1 and ΔMpswd3 strains demonstrated increased sensitivity to cell wall stress with the downregulation of chitin synthase-coding genes. These results indicated that the COMPASS core subunits MpSet1 and MpSwd3 help establish H3K4me2/3 for growth and development, spore formation, and pigment synthesis in Monascus. These core subunits also assist in maintaining cell wall integrity.",9
"GSE249277","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Gene expression of glucose homeostasis in a pancreas-liver microphysiological system","Current research on metabolic disorders and diabetes relies on animal models because multi-organ diseases cannot be well studied with the standard in vitro assays. Here, we connect models of key metabolic organs, pancreas and liver, on a microfluidic chip to enable diabetes research in a human-based preclinical system. Aided by mechanistic mathematical modelling, we show that hyperglycemia and high cortisone induce glucose dysregulation in the pancreas-liver microphysiological system (MPS) mimicking a diabetic phenotype seen in patients with glucocorticoid-induced diabetes. In this diseased condition, pancreas-liver MPS displays beta-cell dysfunction, steatosis, elevated ketone-body secretion, increased glycogen storage, and upregulated gluconeogenic gene expression. In turn, a physiological culture condition rescues the glucose tolerance and beta cell function. This method was evaluated for repeatability in two laboratories and was effective in multiple pancreatic islet donors. The model also provides a platform to identify new therapeutic targets as demonstrated with a combined transcriptome and proteome analysis.",6

To do this, we focused on a Peruvian human cohort that had been previously genotyped who either progressed to active tuberculosis (TB) disease (cases) or did not progress to TB (controls). We isolated monocytes from PBMC samples of these individuals and differentiated in vitro to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MPs). We performed RNA-seq for each sample using a modified Smart-seq protocol for low-input RNA-sequencing. We measured the impact of genetic variants on gene expression by identifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We identified cell-type-specific eQTL genes as well as five genes that showed an interaction between eQTL variants and TB progression status in dendritic cells. We found that the top eQTL interaction with disease history was associated with a gene involved in tyrosine catabolism. ",227

"GSE266485","Mus musculus","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","A disease similarity approach identifies short-lived Niemann-Pick type C disease mice with accelerated brain aging as a novel mouse model for Alzheimer’s disease and aging research","Since its first description in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been the most common type of dementia. Initially thought to be caused by age-associated accumulation of plaques, in recent years, research has increasingly associated AD with lysosomal storage and metabolic disorders, and the explanation of its pathogenesis has shifted from amyloid and tau accumulation to oxidative stress and impaired lipid and glucose metabolism aggravated by hypoxic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms linking those cellular processes and conditions to disease progression have yet to be defined. Here, we applied a disease similarity approach to identify unknown molecular targets of AD by using transcriptomic data from congenital diseases known to increase AD risk, namely Down Syndrome, Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC), and Mucopolysaccharidoses I. We uncovered common pathways, hub genes, and miRNAs across in vitro and in vivo models of these diseases as potential molecular targets for neuroprotection and amelioration of AD pathology, many of which have never been associated with AD. We then investigated common molecular alterations in brain samples from an NPC disease mouse model by juxtaposing them with brain samples of both human and mouse models of AD. Detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses revealed the NPCmut mouse as a novel, short-lived in vivo model of AD characterized by accelerated brain aging, concluding that the NPCmut mouse model can serve as a potential short-lived in vivo model for AD research and for understanding molecular factors affecting brain aging. This research represents the first comprehensive approach to congenital disease association with neurodegeneration and a new perspective on AD research while highlighting shortcomings and lack of correlation in diverse in vitro models. Considering the lack of an AD mouse model that recapitulates the physiological hallmarks of brain aging, the characterization of a short-lived NPC mouse model will further accelerate the research in these fields and offer a unique model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD from a perspective of accelerated brain aging.",12
"GSE244498","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Integrating Tumor and Healthy Epithelium in a Microphysiology Multi-compartment Approach to Study Renal Cell Carcinoma Pathophysiology","The advent of micro-physiological systems (MPS) in biomedical research has enabled the introduction of more complex and relevant physiological into in vitro models. The recreation of complex morphological features in three-dimensional environments can recapitulate otherwise absent dynamic interactions in conventional models. In this study we developed an advanced in vitro Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) that mimics the interplay between healthy and malignant renal tissue. Based on the TissUse Humimic platform our model combines healthy renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) and RCC. Co-culturing reconstructed RPTEC tubules with RCC spheroids in a closed micro-perfused circuit resulted in significant phenotypical changes to the tubules. Expression of immune factors revealed that interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α) were upregulated in the non-malignant cells while neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was downregulated in both RCC and RPTEC. Metabolic analysis revealed that RCC prompted a shift in the energy production of RPTEC tubules, inducing glycolysis, in a metabolic adaptation that likely supports RCC growth and immunogenicity. In contrast, RCC maintained stable metabolic activity, emphasizing their resilience to external factors. RNA-seq and biological process analysis of primary RTPTEC tubules demonstrated that the 3D tubular architecture and MPS conditions reverted cells to a predominant oxidative phosphorylate state, a departure from the glycolytic metabolism observed in 2D culture. This dynamic RCC co-culture model, approximates the physiology of healthy renal tubules to that of RCC, providing new insights into tumor-host interactions. Our approach can show that an RCC-MPS can expand the complexity and scope of pathophysiology and biomarker studies in kidney cancer research.",6

To gain further biochemical insights into MBRs, Exos, and MPs and their emerging role in CRC, we performed, and report here for the first time, a comprehensive transcriptome and long noncoding RNA sequencing analysis and fusion gene identification of these three EV classes using the next-generation RNA sequencing technique. Differential transcript expression analysis revealed that MBRs have a distinct transcriptomic profile compared to Exos and MPs with a high enrichment of mitochondrial transcripts lncRNA/pseudogene transcripts that are predicted to bind to ribonucleoprotein complexes, spliceosome and RNA/stress granule proteins. A salient finding from this study is a high enrichment of several fusion genes in MBRs compared to Exos, MPs and cell lysates from their parental cells such as MSH2 (gene encoded DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2). This suggests potential EV-liquid biopsy targets for cancer detection. Importantly, the expression of cancer progression-related transcripts found in EV classes derived from SW480 (EGFR) and SW620 (MET and MACCA1) cell lines reflects their parental cell types. Our study is the first discovery of RNA and fusion gene compositions within MBRs (including Exos and MPs) that could have an impact on EV functionality in cancer progression and detection using EV-based RNA/ fusion gene candidates for cancer biomarkers",24

Inactivation of the Hippo signaling pathway can rebuild the post ischemic microenvironment and improve cardiac function. We investigated spatially resolved cellular relationships of neonatal and adult renewal-competent hearts to gain insight into inefficient mammalian heart renewal. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell sequencing of adult control hearts and hearts expressing YAP5SA, an active version of the Hippo signaling pathway effector YAP, which models heart renewal, revealed a conserved, renewal-competent cardiomyocyte (CM) population in control hearts and amplified in YAP5SA hearts. This CM population was also found in the wildtype, renewal competent neonatal heart after myocardial infarction, as well as the adult human heart. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), expressing complement C3, colocalized with these CMs. In YAP5SA hearts and neonatal hearts post-MI, macrophages (MPs) expressing complement receptor C3ar1 also colocalized, creating a pro-renewal niche composed of the CM, CF and MP triad. Both C3 and C3ar1 loss-of-function in YAP5SA hearts similarly suppressed heart renewal, indicating that C3-expressing CFs, C3ar1-expressing MPs, and complement system signaling play a direct role in heart renewal",12

Existing in vitro blood vessel models cannot represent the consequent changes in the vascular structure or determine the initial infection site, making it difficult to evaluate how epithelial and endothelial tissues are damaged. Here, we developed a microphysiological system (MPS) that co-culture the bronchial organoids and the vascular bed to analyze infection site and interactions. In this system, virus-infected organoids caused damage in vascular structure. However, vasculature was not damaged or infected when the virus was directly introduced to vascular bed. The knockout of interferon-related genes and inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway reduced the vascular damage, indicating the protective effect of interferon response suppression. The results demonstrate selective infection of bronchial epithelial cells and vascular damage by cytokines and also indicate the applicability of MPS to investigate how the infection influences vascular structure and functions.

"GSE252575","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Extracellular proximity labeling reveals an expanded interactome for the matrisome protein TIMP2","Classical methods of investigating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are generally performed in non-living systems, yet in recent years new technologies utilizing proximity labeling (PL) have given researchers the tools to explore proximal PPIs in living systems. PL has distinct advantages over traditional protein interactome studies, such as the ability to identify weak and transient interactions in vitro and in vivo. Most PL studies are performed on targets within or on the cell membrane. We have adapted the original PL method to investigate PPIs within the extracellular compartment, using both BioID2 and TurboID, that we term extracellular PL (ePL). To demonstrate the utility of this modified technique, we investigate the interactome of the widely expressed matrisome protein Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2). Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are a family of multi-functional proteins that were initially defined by their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of metalloproteinases (MPs), the major mediators of extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown and turnover. TIMP2 exhibits a broad expression profile and is often abundant in both normal and diseased tissues. Understanding the functional transformation of matrisome regulators, like TIMP2, during the evolution of tissue microenvironments associated with disease progression is essential for the development of ECM targeted therapeutics. Using carboxyl- and amino-terminal fusion proteins of TIMP2 with BioID2 and TurboID, we describe the TIMP2 proximal interactome. We also illustrate how the TIMP2 interactome changes in the presence of different stimuli, in different cell types, in unique culture conditions (2D vs 3D), and with different reaction kinetics (BioID2 vs. TurboID); demonstrating the power of this technique versus classical PPI methods. We propose that the screening of matrisome targets in disease models using ePL will reveal new therapeutic targets for further comprehensive studies.",12

Various degrons can be found at protein termini from bacteria to mammals. While N-degrons have been extensively studied, our understanding of C-degrons is still limited. Towards a comprehensive understanding of eukaryotic C-degron pathways, we performed an unbiased survey of C-degrons in budding yeast. We identified over 5000 potential C-degrons by stability profiling of random peptide libraries and of the yeast C-terminome. Combining machine learning, high-throughput mutagenesis and genetic screens revealed that the SCF ubiquitin ligase targets ~40% of degrons using a single F-box substrate receptor Das1. Although sequence-specific, Das1 is highly promiscuous, recognizing a variety of C-degron motifs. By screening for full-length substrates, we implicate SCFDas1 in degradation of orphan protein complex subunits. Altogether, this work highlights the variety of C-degron pathways in eukaryotes and uncovers how an SCF/C-degron pathway of broad specificity contributes to proteostasis.",30

Analysis on albumin secretion, CYP enzyme actvity and differentially expressed genes confirmed that perfusion and direct oxygenation enhanced PXB-cells. Upregulation of ""epoxygenase P450 pathway"" GO terms indicated involvement of Arachidonic Acid (ARA) in the crosstalk mechanism. This is further confirmed by comparing the effect of ARA and coculture toward PXB-cells CYP enzymes activity. We hypothesize that some stimulus from PXB-cells resulted made iPS-derived intestine cells released ARA in form of lipoprotein, which is then taken in by PXB-cells and enhanced CYP activity.",12

However, NK cell function is suppressed during the disease, and the orchestrators of this impairment are not fully understood. Using a chimeric BCR::ABL1+ CML mouse model, we characterized the impact of the leukemic microenvironment on NK cell function and gene transcription. To address the latter, we profiled NK cells from spleen and bone marrow of CML and healthy mice by single-cell RNA sequencing. We revealed an inflammatory cytokine response in CML-exposed NK cells, highlighted by the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa)-induced gene signature, upregulation of TNFa receptor TNFR2, and enrichment of SOCS family genes such as Cish, the critical NK cell checkpoint. Ex vivo exposure of healthy NK cells to leukemic soluble factors compromised target-specific NK cell degranulation, which was partially rescued by inhibiting Cish or TNFa - candidate targets reveiled by scRNA-seq. In alignment with these findings, NK cells from healthy donors displayed suppressed cytotoxicity when exposed to plasma from untreated CML patients, with a partial restoration upon Cish or TNFa inhibition. Furthermore, NK cells from newly diagnosed CML patients pre-destined for blast crisis showed an enrichment of the TNFa-induced pro-inflammatory gene signature identified in CML mice.

In vitro models of NASH play a crucial role in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and evaluating the efficacy of pharmacological interventions. Several preclinical models of MASH have been developed and are being used extensively to study these areas. While standard cell culture models allow for elucidation of certain molecular pathways involved in MASH pathogenesis, they lack three-dimensional architecture and cellular heterogeneity observed in native liver tissue, potentially limiting their physiological relevance and inability to fully capture the multifactorial nature of the disease Precision cut liver slices from MASH livers retain the complex multicellular architecture of the liver including hepatocyte arrangement, sinusoidal structure, and cellular interactions, but the metabolism deteriorates over a short period of time (usually reported as 2 days). Human liver organoids from iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells) retain the genetics of the patients but fail to fully differentiate into hepatocytes or have the liver architecture. Human liver spheroids incubated in a MASH cocktail develop several phenotypic characteristics of a MASH liver, but the small spheroid size precludes extensive histological comparisons to MASH livers. Microphysiological systems (MPS) or “liver on a chip” in which 3D cultures are perfused, maintain many of the physiological functions of the liver owing to precise control over microenvironmental parameters, including fluid flow, nutrient gradients, and mechanical cues. However, MPS are difficult to scale up and have not been developed to reproduce a MASH phenotype.  In comparison, bioprinted liver tissues for MASH have many advantages. Organovo’s 3D bioprinted liver tissues are comprised of all major primary liver cells including hepatocytes, endothelial cells, stellates and Kupffer cells, mixed in physiologically relevant ratios. These cells are then bioprinted in precise pre-defined liver specific geometries to recapitulate complexity of the hepatic microenvironment.. This mimicking of tissue architecture enables more accurate representation of cellular interactions, spatial organization, and microenvironmental cues crucial for MASH pathogenesis. The liver tissues developed using this method maintain differentiation and metabolism over several weeks. In this paper, we further demonstrated that upon treatment with a MASH induction cocktail, these liver tissues respond accurately by developing steatosis and fibrosis Tissue response varies depending in response to the complexity of the MASH cocktail.",22

CEBPA encodes a long (p42) and a truncated (p30) protein isoform from a single mRNA. Mutations that abnormally enhance expression of p30 are associated with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We show by mutational analysis that three highly conserved arginine residues (R140,147,154) located at the p30 C/EBPα N-terminus, previously found to be methylated, are involved in myeloid lineage commitment, progenitor proliferation, and differentiation.

"GSE276122","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Combined targeting of GPX4 and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase selectively compromises BCR-ABL+ leukemia stem cells","Background In the ongoing battle against BCR-ABL+ leukemia, despite significant advances with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the persistent challenges of drug resistance and the enduring presence of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) remain formidable barriers to achieving a cure.  Methods In this study, we demonstrated that Disulfiram (DSF) induces ferroptosis to synergize with TKIs in inhibiting BCR-ABL+ cells, particularly targeting resistant cells and LSCs, using cell models, mouse models, and primary cells from patients. We elucidated the mechanism by which DSF promotes GPX4 degradation to induce ferroptosis through immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), RNA sequencing, lipid peroxidation assays, and rescue experiments. Results Here, we present compelling evidence elucidating the sensitivity of DSF, an FDA-approved drug for alcohol dependence, towards BCR-ABL+ cells. Our findings underscore DSF's ability to selectively induce a potent cytotoxic effect on BCR-ABL+ cell lines and effectively inhibit primary BCR-ABL+ leukemia cells. Crucially, the combined treatment of DSF with TKIs selectively eradicates TKI-insensitive stem cells and resistant cells. Of particular note is DSF's capacity to disrupt GPX4 stability, elevate the labile iron pool, and intensify lipid peroxidation, ultimately leading to ferroptotic cell death. Our investigation shows that BCR-ABL expression induces alterations in cellular iron metabolism and increases GPX4 expression. Additionally, we demonstrate the indispensability of GPX4 for LSC development and the initiation/maintenance of BCR-ABL+ leukemia. Mechanical analysis further elucidates DSF's ability to circumvent resistance by reducing GPX4 levels through the disruption of its binding with HSPA8, thereby promoting GPX4 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Furthermore, the combined treatment of DSF with TKIs effectively targets both BCR-ABL+ blast cells and drug-insensitive LSCs, conferring a significant survival advantage in mouse models. Conclusion In summary, the dual inhibition of GPX4 and BCR-ABL presents a promising therapeutic strategy to synergistically target blast cells and drug-insensitive LSCs in patients, offering potential avenues for advancing leukemia treatment.",4

While RAG1 and RAG2 have been shown to bind various regions genome-wide, the in vivo off-target DNA damage instigated by RAG1/2 endonuclease remains less well understood. In the current study, we identified regions containing RAG1/2-induced DNA breaks in mouse pre-B cells on a genome-wide scale using a global DNA DSB detection strategy. Around 1500 putative RAG1/2-dependent DSBs were identified, most of which were located outside the Ig loci.

Dysregulation in the epidermal differentiation process contributes to barrier dysfunction and is implicated in the pathology of various dermatological diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate (MPS) is used as a moisturizing agent for xerosis in AD patients. However, its mechanism of action on keratinocytes, the main constituent of the epidermis, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of MPS on keratinocytes by subjecting adult human epidermal keratinocyte (HEKa) cells and three-dimensional cultured keratinocytes to MPS treatment, followed by transcriptome analysis. The analysis revealed that MPS treatment enhances keratinocyte differentiation and suppresses proliferation. We focused on amphiregulin (AREG), a membrane protein that belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and possesses a heparin-binding domain, as a significant target of the MPS among the genes altered by MPS. It is revealed that MPS exerts an inhibitory effect directly on AREG, rather than on the EGF receptor or other members of the EGF family. Furthermore, it is suggested that AREG leads to a reduction in epidermal barrier function, whereas MPS contributes to barrier enhancement through AREG inhibition. Collectively, these findings suggest that MPS modulates barrier function through the inhibition of AREG, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for skin barrier restoration.",33

The recreation of complex morphological features in three-dimensional environments can recapitulate otherwise absent dynamic interactions in conventional models. In this study we developed an advanced in vitro Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) that mimics the interplay between healthy and malignant renal tissue. Based on the TissUse Humimic platform our model combines healthy renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) and RCC. Co-culturing reconstructed RPTEC tubules with RCC spheroids in a closed micro-perfused circuit resulted in significant phenotypical changes to the tubules. Expression of immune factors revealed that interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α) were upregulated in the non-malignant cells while neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was downregulated in both RCC and RPTEC. Metabolic analysis revealed that RCC prompted a shift in the energy production of RPTEC tubules, inducing glycolysis, in a metabolic adaptation that likely supports RCC growth and immunogenicity. In contrast, RCC maintained stable metabolic activity, emphasizing their resilience to external factors. RNA-seq and biological process analysis of primary RTPTEC tubules demonstrated that the 3D tubular architecture and MPS conditions reverted cells to a predominant oxidative phosphorylate state, a departure from the glycolytic metabolism observed in 2D culture. This dynamic RCC co-culture model, approximates the physiology of healthy renal tubules to that of RCC, providing new insights into tumor-host interactions.

However, in order to gain comprehensive understanding of a drug response, a prediction model should reflect the underlying biological mechanisms, but the current models suffer from interpretability and scalability problems. Machine learning-based prediction models base their predictions on inferred features, which usually are not well correlated with biological mechanisms, posing a challenge on interpretability of its response predictions. In this regard, using Boolean modeling schemes may allow interpretations on mechanisms that contribute to a particular response, but optimizing Boolean models is difficult because of their high dimensional search space and discontinuous loss function. Here, we developed a scalable derivative-free optimizer for weighted sum Boolean network through meta-reinforcement learning. By using graph network and coordinate-wise policy, our learned optimizer can optimize high dimensional Boolean networks containing over 100 parameters of arbitrary structure, showing higher sample efficiency compared with other meta-heuristic algorithms. The optimized Boolean networks successfully predict the drug responses congruent with public databases and in-house experimental data.

Given that hypoxia is a common feature in a wide array of pathophysiological contexts such as tumor and that IFN-g is instrumental for protective immunity, it is of great significance to gain a clear idea on this. Combining pharmacological and genetic gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we find that HIF1a-glycolysis controls IFN-g induction in both human and mouse T cells activated under hypoxia. Specific deletion of HIF1a in T cells (HIF1a–/–) and glycolytic inhibition significantly abrogate IFN-g induction. Conversely, HIF1a stabilization in T cells by hypoxia and VHL deletion (VHL–/–) promotes IFN-g production. Mechanistically, reduced IFN-g production in hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells is due to attenuated activation-induced cell death but not proliferative defect. We further show that depletion of intracellular acetyl-CoA  is a key metabolic underlying mechanism. Hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells are less able to kill tumor cells, and HIF1a–/– tumor-bearing mice are not responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, indicating loss of HIF1a in T cells is a major mechanism of therapeutic resistance to ICBs. Importantly, acetate supplementation restores IFN-g production in hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells and re-sensitizes HIF1a–/– tumor-bearing mice to ICBs, providing an effective strategy to overcome ICB resistance.

"GSE254639","synthetic construct","Other","Deep mutational scanning reveals a tight correlation between protein degradation and toxicity of thousands of non-native aspartoacylase protein variants","When the structural stability of a protein is compromised, the protein may form non-native interactions with other cell proteins and thus becomes a hazard to the cell. To mitigate this danger, destabilized proteins are targeted by the cellular protein quality control (PQC) network, which either corrects the folding defect or targets the protein for degradation. However, the details of how the protein folding and degradation systems collaborate to combat potentially toxic non-native proteins are unknown. To address this issue, we performed systematic studies on destabilized variants of the cytosolic aspartoacylase, ASPA, where loss-of-function variants are linked to Canavan’s disease, an autosomal recessive and lethal neurological disorder, characterized by the spongy degeneration of the white matter in the brain. Using Variant Abundance by Massively Parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), we determined the abundance of 6152 out of the 6260 (~98%) possible single-site missense and nonsense ASPA variants in cultured human cells. The majority of the low abundance ASPA variants are degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and become toxic upon prolonged expression. Variant cellular abundance data correlates with predicted thermodynamic stability, evolutionary conservation, and separates most known disease-linked variants from benign variants. Systematic mapping of degradation signals (degrons) shows that inherent primary degrons in ASPA are located in buried regions, and reveals that the wild-type ASPA C-terminal region functions as a degron. Collectively, our data can be used to interpret Canavan’s disease variants and also offer mechanistic insight into how ASPA missense variants are targeted by the PQC system. These are essential steps towards future implementation of precision medicine for Canavan’s disease.",61

It is characterized by weakness, frequent falls, cognitive decline, increased hospitalization and dead, and represents a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The fact that frailty is recognized as a reversible condition, encourages the identification of earlier biomarkers to timely predict and prevent its occurrence. SAMP8 (Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone-8) mice represent the most appropriate preclinical model to this aim and were used in this study to carry transcriptional and metabolic analyses in the brain and plasma respectively, upon a characterization at cognitive, motor, structural and neuropathological level at 2.5, 6 and 9 months of age. At 2.5 months SAMP8 mice started displaying memory deficits, muscle weakness and motor impairment. Functional alterations were associated with a neurodevelopment deficiency associated with reduced neuronal density and glial cell loss. Through transcriptomics we identified specific genetic signatures well distinguishing SAMP8 mice at 6 months and correlating with motor and cognitive dysfunction, whereas plasma metabolomics allowed to segregate SAMP8 mice from SAMR1 already at 2.5 months of age by detecting constitutively lower levels of acylcarnitines and lipids in SAMP8 at all ages investigated.

Conventional treatments for chemotherapy-induced POI are unsatisfactory. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a therapeutic option, but the impact of estrogen niche-respond MSC secretome on ovarian regeneration and circadian rhythm remains unknown. This study revealed that the secretome of ER+pcMSCs (conditioned medium [CM] and E2-CM, respectively) significantly reduced the CTX-induced defects in ovarian folliculogenesis and circadian rhythm. The CM/E2-CM also reduced granulosa cell apoptosis and rescued angiogenesis in POI ovarian tissues. E2-CM presented a better effect than the CM. Cytokine array analysis showed a significant increase in cytokine/growth factors associated with immunomodulation and angiogenesis (including angiogenin). Neutralizing angiogenin in the CM/E2-CM significantly decreased its ability to promote HUVEC tube formation in vitro.

Mechanistically, spermidine activates SCs via generating hypusinated eIF5A. Using SC-specific eIF5A-knockout (KO) and Myod-KO mice, we further found that eIF5A is required for spermidine-mediated SC activation by controlling MyoD translation.

Given that hypoxia is a common feature in a wide array of pathophysiological contexts such as tumor and that IFN-g is instrumental for protective immunity, it is of great significance to gain a clear idea on this. Combining pharmacological and genetic gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we find that HIF1a-glycolysis controls IFN-g induction in both human and mouse T cells activated under hypoxia. Specific deletion of HIF1a in T cells (HIF1a–/–) and glycolytic inhibition significantly abrogate IFN-g induction. Conversely, HIF1a stabilization in T cells by hypoxia and VHL deletion (VHL–/–) promotes IFN-g production. Mechanistically, reduced IFN-g production in hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells is due to attenuated activation-induced cell death but not proliferative defect. We further show that depletion of intracellular acetyl-CoA  is a key metabolic underlying mechanism. Hypoxic HIF1a–/– T cells are less able to kill tumor cells, and HIF1a–/– tumor-bearing mice are not responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, indicating loss of HIF1a in T cells is a major mechanism of therapeutic resistance to ICBs.

We found that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC)s can obtain mitochondria from macrophages through tunnel nanotubes (TNT)s. Mitochondria are crucial for the metabolism and function of BMSC. We further designed a composite hydrogel based on aldehyde sodium hyaluronate and chitosan as the network matrix, containing anti-inflammatory dimethyl itaconate (DMI) and macrophage-targeted zwitterionic nanoparticles (MDVNPs). The acidic bone injury microenvironment triggers a reversible Schiff base reaction in response to pH; further, the released DMI upregulates the M2 phenotype of macrophages by reducing the ROS level. Subsequently, MDVNPs with targeting, high transfection, and low immunogenicity accelerated the efficiency of mitochondrial transfer between macrophages and BMSC by increasing the expression of the mitochondrial transfer regulatory protein Rho GTPase 1 (Miro1). In vitro studies have confirmed that promoting mitochondrial transfer can effectively increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) levels in BMSC, promoting osteoblastic differentiation.

C. sinensis, classified as a definite group I carcinogen by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), is an important risk factor for HCC. Although many studies have shown that C. sinensis infection affects the prognosis of HCC patients, the specific mechanisms are still unclear, especially the dynamics and regulatory roles of chromatin accessibility. Results: In this study, we integrated ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq data to elucidate changes in the epigenetics of HCC after the C. sinensis infection. Many different accessibility regions (DARs) were identified both in tumors and adjacent tissue after the C. sinensis infection. Meanwhile, top TFs whose motifs were enriched in DAR were found, such as HNF4a, FOXI1, etc. Although there were slight deviations, epigenetic changes were found to be consistent with gene expression levels. We also revealed that H3K9ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 were associated with chromatin accessibility.

Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to detect significant genes and pathways involved in CS extract supplementation responsiveness of PBMCs after PRRSV infection. RNA sequencing was conducted on PBMCs, which were isolated from six weaned piglets. The resultant transcriptional responses were examined by mRNA sequencing. Differential expression analysis identified 263 and 274 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the PRRSV and CTRL groups, and the PRRSV+CS and CTRL groups, respectively. Among these, ZNF646 and KAT5 emerged as the most promising candidate genes, potentially influencing the interaction between PRRSV-infected PBMCs and CS extract supplementation through the regulation of gene networks and cellular homeostasis during stress. Two pathways were detected to be associated with CS extract supplementation responsiveness: the cellular response to stress pathway and the NF-kB signaling pathway. Consequently, our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying cellular stress response and the NF-κB signaling pathway in PRRSV-infected PBMCs, and identifies a potential application of CS extract for activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, by supplementing CS extract in PBMC cells infected with PRRSV, we found that CS extract modulates PRRSV infection by inducing cellular stress, which is regulated by the NF-κB signaling pathway.

Radiation therapy can change the interaction between the cancer cells and the stroma through release of innate adjuvants including the STING agonist cGAMP. Enpp1 is a phosphodiesterase that can be expressed by cancer cells and can degrade cGAMP. Enpp1 can therefore limit innate adjuvant availability following radiation therapy. We observed that many cancer cells lack Enpp1 expression, but that Enpp1 expression is retained in cells of the tumor stroma and this expression in the tumor stroma limits tumor control by radiation therapy. We demonstrate the efficacy of a novel Enpp1 inhibitor and show that this inhibitor improves tumor control by radiation even where the cancer cells lack Enpp1. We show that the mechanism requires STING and type I IFN receptor expression by non-cancer cells, and is dependent on CD8 T cells as a final effector mechanism of tumor control. This suggests that Enpp1 inhibition may be an effective partner for radiation therapy regardless of whether cancer cells express Enpp1, and identifies a novel therapeutic Enpp1 inhibitor suitable for combination therapies in immuno-oncology.",37

However, their application is currently hindered by the low production yields of existing protocols. We aim to develop a bioprocess able to generate high numbers of HLC. We used stirred-tank bioreactors with a rational control of dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) for the optimization of HLC production as 3D aggregates. We evaluated the impact of controlling DO at physiological levels (4%O2) during hepatic progenitors’ stage on cell proliferation and differentiation efficiency. Whole transcriptome analysis and biochemical assays were performed to provide a detailed characterization of HLC quality attributes. When DO was controlled at 4%O2 during the hepatic progenitors’ stage, cells presented an upregulation of genes associated with hypoxia-inducible factor pathway and a downregulation of oxidative stress genes. This condition promoted higher HLC production (maximum cell concentration: 2×106 cell/mL) and improved differentiation efficiencies (80% Albumin-positive cells) when compared to the bioreactor operated under atmospheric oxygen levels (21%O2, 0.6×106 cell/mL, 43% Albumin positive cells). These HLC exhibited functional characteristics of hepatocytes: capacity to metabolize drugs, ability to synthesize hepatic metabolites, and inducible cytochrome P450 activity. Bioprocess robustness was confirmed with HLC derived from different donors, including a primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) patient. The generated PH1.HLC showed metabolic features of PH1 disease with higher secretion of oxalate compared with HLC generated from healthy individuals. This work reports a reproducible bioprocess, that shows the importance of controlling DO at physiological levels to increase HLC production, and the HLC capability to display PH1 disease features.",27

In bacteria, ProQ-like proteins have emerged as important RNA chaperones facilitating RNA stability and RNA duplex formation. In the major human pathogen V. cholerae, post-transcriptional gene regulation is key for virulence, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance, yet the role of ProQ has not been studied.

Breakdown of the BRB leads to the development of retinal diseases. Here, we show that Netrin-1/Unc5b and Norrin/Lrp5 signaling establish a zonated endothelial cell gene expression program that controls BRB integrity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of postnatal BRB-competent mouse retina endothelial cells (ECs), we investigate >100 BRB genes encoding Wnt signaling components, tight junction proteins, and ion and nutrient transporters. We find that BRB gene expression is zonated across arteries, capillaries, and veins and regulated by opposing gradients of the Netrin-1 receptor Unc5b and Lrp5-β-catenin signaling between retinal arterioles and venules. Mice deficient for Ntn1 or Unc5b display more BRB leakage at the arterial end of the vasculature, while Lrp5 loss of function causes predominantly venular BRB leakage. ScRNA-seq of Ntn1 and Unc5b mutant ECs reveals down-regulated β-catenin signaling and  BRB gene expression that is rescued by Ctnnb1 overactivation, along with BRB integrity. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 and Norrin additively enhance β-catenin transcriptional activity and Lrp5 phosphorylation via the Discs large homologue 1 (Dlg1) scaffolding protein, and endothelial Lrp5-Unc5b function converges in protection of capillary BRB integrity.

The pathophysiology of lung I/R injury involves ferroptosis and elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, while the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on lung I/R injury remains unclear. This research aimed to explore the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on reducing ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells caused by I/R.  First, we identified O-GlcNAc transferase 1 (Ogt1) as a differentially expressed gene in lung epithelial cells of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) patients, using single-cell sequencing, and Gene Ontology analysis (GO analysis) revealed the enrichment of the ferroptosis process. We found a time-dependent dynamic alteration in lung O-GlcNAcylation during I/R injury. Proteomics analysis identified the differentially expressed proteins enriched in ferroptosis and multiple redox-related pathways based on KEGG annotation. Thus, we generated Ogt1-conditional knockout mice and found that Ogt1 deficiency aggravated ferroptosis, as evidenced by lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), Fe2+, as well as alterations in critical protein expression glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Consistently, we found that elevated O-GlcNAcylation inhibited ferroptosis sensitivity in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury-induced TC-1 cells via O-GlcNAcylated NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, both the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that Nrf2 could bind with translation start site (TSS) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and promote its transcriptional activity. As an important rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), elevated G6PDH provided a mass of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to improve the redox state of glutathione (GSH) and eventually led to ferroptosis resistance. Rescue experiments proved that Nrf2 knockdown or Nrf2-T334A (O-GlcNAcylation site) mutation abolished the protective effect of ferroptosis resistance.  In summary, we revealed that O-GlcNAcylation could protect against I/R lung injury by reducing ferroptosis sensitivity via the Nrf2/G6PDH pathway.

Newly metastasising cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours.  There is interest in exploiting this vulnerability to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis.  Here, we show that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, including with aspirin, enhances immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelet TXA2 triggers an immunosuppressive pathway within T cells dependent upon the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor (TCR)-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases.  Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or through platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner dependent upon T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo.  These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway limiting T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing a mechanistic basis for the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.",15

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an anti-inflammatory drug approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. We previously reported that DMF effectively inhibits acute GVHD (aGVHD) while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, the role of DMF in cGVHD progression remains unknown. Here, we found that DMF administration significantly suppresses follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation, germinal center formation and alleviates disease severity in different murine cGVHD models. Mechanistically, DMF treatment downregulates IL-21 transcription by activation of Nrf2, thus orchestrating Tfh-related gene program both in mice and humans. The inhibitory role of DMF on Tfh cell differentiation was diminished in Nrf2 deficient T cells. Importantly, the therapeutic potential of DMF in clinical cGVHD has been validated in human data whereby DMF effectively reduces IL-21 production and Tfh cell generation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from active cGVHD patients and further attenuates xenograft GVHD. Collectively, our findings reveal that DMF potently inhibits cGVHD development by repressing Tfh cell differentiation via Nrf2, paving way for the treatment of cGVHD in the clinic.",4

However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this critical process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac), a mark on newly-synthesized H3, facilitates the remodeling of disorganized nucleosomes in nascent chromatin, and its removal at the subsequent G2/M phase of the cell cycle marks the completion of chromatin maturation. In vitro, H3K56ac enhances the activity of ISWI chromatin remodelers, including yeast ISW1 and its human equivalent SNF2h. In vivo, a deficiency of H3K56ac in nascent chromatin results in the formation of closely packed di-nucleosomes and/or tetra-nucleosomes. In contrast, abnormally high H3K56ac levels disrupt chromatin maturation, leading to genome instability. These findings establish a central role of H3K56ac in chromatin maturation and reveal a mechanism regulating this critical aspect of chromosome replication.",116

Single-cell RNAseq analysis of MHCII-mismatched heart transplants developing chronic rejection identified graft IL-33 as a stimulator of tissue repair pathways in infiltrating myeloid cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Using IL-33-deficient donor mice, it was revealed that graft fibroblast-derived IL-33 potently induced Amphiregulin (Areg) expression by recipient Treg. Areg is an epidermal growth factor secreted by multiple immune cells to shape immunomodulation and tissue repair. In particular, Areg is proposed to play a major role in Treg-mediated muscle, epithelium, and nerve repair. Assessing recipient mice with Treg-specific deletion of Areg demonstrated that this pathway surprisingly contributes to chronic rejection. Specifically, heart transplants from recipients with Areg-deficient Tregs exhibited less vasculopathy and vessel-associated fibrotic niches infiltrated by recipient T cells. Mechanistically, we show that Areg does not impact Treg suppressive function, but that IL-33 mediated Treg-secretion of Areg increases fibroblast proliferation and migration. In total, these studies identify how a dysregulated repair response involving interactions between IL-33+ fibroblasts in the allograft and recipient Treg contributes to the progression of chronic rejection.",2

Some MCT8 deficient patients are not as severely affected than others due to residual thyroid hormone (TH) transport. Previously, we hypothesized that these patients’ mutations destabilize the MCT8 protein, which consequently will be sent for degradation. We have already demonstrated that the chemical chaperone sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) rescues the function of these mutants by stabilizing their protein expression in an overexpressing cell system. Here we expand our previous work and used human iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMECs) as a model. We could show that NaPB rescues decreased mutant MCT8 expression and restores transport function. Furthermore, we identified MCT10 as another TH transporter that contributes to T3 uptake. The decrease in mutant protein expression could be explained by the activation of components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) machinery. Increased expression after NaPB treatment is a consequence of UPR attenuation and the stabilization of MCT8 mRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that NaPB is suitable to stabilize pathogenic missense mutations and activate transport function in a human-derived cell model opening the possibility of repurposing the FDA-approved drug NaPB for MCT8 deficiency.",19

The end-protecting activity of Shieldin promotes productive non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in G1 but can threaten genome integrity during S-phase by blocking homologous recombination (HR). Curiously, the penultimate Shieldin component, SHLD1 is one of the least abundant mammalian proteins. Here, we report that the transcription factors THAP1, YY1 and HCF1 bind directly to the SHLD1 promoter, where they cooperatively maintain the low basal expression of SHLD1. Functionally, this transcriptional network ensures that SHLD1 protein levels are kept in check to enable a proper balance between end protection and end resection during physiological DSB repair. In the context of BRCA1 deficiency, loss of THAP1 dependent SHLD1 expression confers cross resistance to PARP inhibitor and cisplatin, and shorter progression free survival in ovarian cancer patients.

While many individual examples of transcriptional regulation of metabolism have been reported, a systems-level study of how metabolic gene expression responds to such perturbations is lacking in any animal. Here, we apply worm perturb-seq (WPS), a high-throughput, whole-animal RNAi/RNA-seq method, on ~900 metabolic genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, to derive a metabolic gene regulatory network (mGRN) in which the knockdown of 365 metabolic genes is connected to 9,414 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by more than 110,000 interactions. The mGRN has a highly modular structure in which distinct 22 perturbation clusters connect to 44 co-regulated gene expression programs. We uncover widespread yet highly specific responses in genes associated with stress responses and food digestion, along with various modes of transcriptional changes from simple ‘within pathway’ to complex ‘network coordination’. By integrating the mGRN with metabolic network modeling, we elucidate an underlying designing principle of transcriptional rewiring that leads us to propose a ‘compensation/repression model’ in which high-level, core metabolic functions regulate each other, likely to maintain animal homeostasis.",73

In the current study, we developed inducible, cell-type specific Gba KO mice to understand the individual impacts of Gba deficiencies on microglia and neurons.

Here we characterize the prevalence and functional consequences of microRNA tailing in vivo, using Caenorhabditis elegans. MicroRNA tailing in C. elegans consists mostly of mono-uridylation of mature microRNA species, with rarer mono-adenylation which is likely added to microRNA precursors. Through a targeted RNAi screen, we discover that the TUT4/TUT7 gene family member CID-1/CDE-1/PUP-1 is required for uridylation, whereas the GLD2 gene family member F31C3.2-here named GLD-2-related 2 (GLDR-2)-is required for adenylation. Thus, the TUT4/TUT7 and GLD2 gene families have broadly conserved roles in miRNA modification. We specifically examine the role of tailing in microRNA turnover. We determine half-lives of microRNAs after acute inactivation of microRNA biogenesis, revealing that half-lives are generally long (median = 20.7 h), as observed in other systems. Although we observe that the proportion of tailed species increases over time after biogenesis, disrupting tailing does not alter microRNA decay. Thus, tailing is not a global regulator of decay in C. elegans.

Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 (RHA1), a potential biocatalytic chassis, grows on EG. Transcriptomic analyses revealed four clusters of genes potentially involved in EG catabolism: the mad locus, predicted to encode mycofactocin-dependent alcohol degradation, including the catabolism of EG to glycolate; two GCL clusters, predicted to encode glycolate and glyoxylate catabolism; and the mft genes, predicted to specify mycofactocin biosynthesis. Bioinformatic analyses further revealed that the mad and mft genes are widely distributed in mycolic acid-producing bacteria such as RHA1. Neither ΔmadA nor ΔmftC RHA1 mutant strains grew on EG but grew on acetate. In resting cell assays, the ΔmadA mutant depleted glycolaldehyde but not EG from culture media. These results indicate that madA encodes a mycofactocin-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase that initiates EG catabolism. In contrast to some mycobacterial strains, the mad genes did not appear to enable RHA1 to grow on methanol as sole substrate. Finally, a strain of RHA1 adapted to grow ~3× faster on EG contained an overexpressed gene, aldA2, predicted to encode an aldehyde dehydrogenase. When incubated with EG, this strain accumulated lower concentrations of glycolaldehyde than RHA1. Moreover, ecotopically expressed aldA2 increased RHA1’s tolerance for EG further suggesting that glycolaldehyde accumulation limits growth of RHA1 on EG.

C. elegans FBF-2, a PUF RNA-binding protein, binds over 1000 RNAs to govern stem cells and differentiation. FBF-2 interacts with multiple protein partners via a key tyrosine, Y479. Here we investigate the in vivo significance of partnerships using a Y479A mutant. Y479A occupancy increases or decreases at specific sites across the transcriptome, varying with the RNA, and shifts from 3’UTRs to other regions. Germline development also changes in a very specific fashion: Y479A abolishes one FBF-2 function – the sperm to oocyte cell fate switch. Y479A changes to regulation of one mRNA, gld-1, are critical to this fate change, though other network changes are also important. FBF-2 switches from repression to activation of gld-1 RNA, likely by distinct FBF-2 partnerships. The role of partnerships in governing RNA regulatory networks will extend broadly, including for human health and disease, as protein partnerships pervade RNA control. ",16

Current in vitro systems to derive PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) from pluripotent cells use large embryoid bodies, exposed to signalling cocktails, that do not recapitulate the native embryonic environment during PGC formation. Here we show that mouse gastruloids, three-dimensional in vitro models of gastrulation, generate a population of Gastruloid-derived PGC-like cells (Gld-PGCLCs) that resemble early PGCs in vivo. Importantly, the conserved organisation of mouse gastruloids leads to coordinated spatial and temporal localisation of Gld-PGCLCs relative to surrounding somatic cells, even in the absence of exogenous PGC-specific signalling or extraembryonic tissues. In gastruloids, self-organised interactions between cells and tissues, including the endodermal epithelium, enables the specification, migration, and subsequent maturation of a pool of Gld-PGCLCs. As such, mouse gastruloids represent a new source of PGCLCs in vitro and, due to their inherent co-development, serve as a novel model of dynamic PGC development within integrated tissue environments.",12
"GSE238214","Mus musculus","Expression profiling by array","Transcriptional characterization of primary tumors and liver metastasis from 4T1-derived liver-metastatic cells","Metabolic rewiring is essential for breast tumor growth and progression to metastatic disease, yet little is known regarding how cancer cells modify their acquired metabolic programs in response to different metastatic microenvironments. Transcriptional and metabolomic analysis have previously shown that liver-metastatic breast cancer cells adopt an intrinsic metabolic profile characterized by increased HIF-1α activity and dependence on glycolysis. Stable isotope tracing analysis (SITA) performed in vivo confirmed that the glycolytic nature of liver-metastatic breast cancer cells is retained when these cells are grown as primary tumors or as liver metastases. However, our data also reveal that unique metabolic adaptations are specifically induced by the liver microenvironment. Indeed, liver metastases display elevated expression of genes involved in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification when compared to primary tumors. Moreover, breast cancer liver metastases rely strongly on glucose and glutamine-derived carbons to support de novo GSH synthesis. Glutathione is a tripeptide that acts as a major scavenger for reactive oxygen species (ROS). Liver metastases display reduced levels of 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, confirming their increased capacity to buffer ROS. We demonstrated the dependence of liver metastases formation on these distinct metabolic adaptations by depleting glutamate-cysteine ligase (Gcl), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis. Gcl depletion, and decreased GSH levels, strongly reduced the capacity of liver-metastatic cells to form distant metastasis within the liver. We performed gene expression analysis of liver metastasis and primary tumors from liver-metastatic breast cancer cells derived from 4T1 cells. 4T1-2776 (76) and 4T1-2792 (92) cells were injected in the mammary fat pads of BALB/c and grown as primary tumors or were grown as liver metastasis after splenic injection. Tissues were harvested from primary tumors and liver metastasis and submitted to laser-capture microdissection (LCM). For liver metastasis, tumour tissue was harvested at 10 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks after splenic injection. For each time point, tissue was isolated from the tumor centre (core), a peripheral area of the tumor (margin), a region of the liver proximal to the tumor (adjacent) and a region of the liver far from the tumor (distant). For primary tumors from 4T1-2776 cells (1034, 1036, 1043) and 4T1-2792 (MFP2L, MFP3L, MFP5L) tissue was collected from the tumor core and margin, at the experimental endpoint.",64

It is characterized by distinctive facial features, brachydactyly, sleep disturbances and stereotypic behaviors. We investigated a cohort of 15 individuals with a clinical suspicion of SMS, who showed neither deletion in the SMS critical region nor damaging variants in RAI1. Potentially deleterious variants were identified in nine of these subjects using whole-exome sequencing. Eight of these changes affect KMT2D, ZEB2, MAP2K2, GLDC, CASK, MECP2, KDM5C and POGZ, known to be associated with Kabuki syndrome 1, Mowat-Wilson syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, glycine encephalopathy, mental retardation and microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia, X-linked mental retardation 13, X-linked mental retardation Claes-Jensen type and White-Sutton syndrome, respectively. The ninth individual carries a de novo variant in JAKMIP1, a regulator of neuronal translation that was recently found deleted in a patient with autism spectrum disorder. Analyses of coexpression and biomedical text mining suggest that these pathologies and SMS are part of the same disease network. Further support for this hypothesis was obtained from transcriptome profiling that showed that the expression levels of both Zeb2 and Map2k2 are perturbed in Rai1-/- mice. As an orthogonal approach to potentially contributory disease gene variants, we used chromatin conformation capture to reveal chromatin contacts between RAI1 and the loci flanking ZEB2 and GLDC, as well as between RAI1 and human orthologs of the genes that show perturbed expression in our Rai1-/- mouse model.

We generated Faslpr mice deficient in EAF2, a transcription elongation-associated factor known to promote apoptosis in germinal center (GC) B cells and crucial for preventing autoimmunity. Contrary to expectations, EAF2 deficiency significantly reduced lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, extended lifespan, and alleviated nephritis by decreasing autoantibody production and reducing immune complex deposition in the kidneys. Additionally, EAF2 deficiency markedly reduced accumulation of activated B cells, GC B cells, and plasma cells in Faslpr mice. Moreover, the abnormal B220+CD3+ T cells typically observed in Faslpr mice were substantially reduced by EAF2 deficiency. Further analysis revealed that Eaf2-/-Faslpr B cells showed hyperactivation upon various stimulations, followed by increased death. RNA sequencing of the B220+CD3+ cells revealed a downregulation in survival-promoting genes such as Bcl-2 and Akt and an upregulation of proapoptotic genes.

Although many studies have elucidated the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epigenetic regulatory mechanism from NAFL to NASH remains incompletely understood. The histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, MLL4 (also called KMT2D), is a critical epigenetic transcriptional coactivator that mediates overnutrition-induced steatosis in mice, but its potential role in the progression of NASH remains largely unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking the one allele of the Mll4 gene are resistant to hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH conditions compared to wild-type controls. Transcriptome analysis of the livers of control and Mll4+/- mice identified pro-inflammatory genes regulated by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway as major target genes of MLL4. We show that MLL4 binds to p65 and that MLL4 is required for NF-κB transactivation. Myeloid-specific Mll4 knockout mice showed an almost complete block of NASH, while hepatocyte-specific Mll4 knockout mice showed mild inhibition of steatosis. Pro-inflammatory M1 polarization is decreased and anti-inflammatory M2 polarization is increased in liver macrophages from myeloid-specific Mll4 knockout mice. Importantly, we show that histone H3-lysine 4 methylation mediated by the MLL4-complex plays a critical role in promoting the expression of Ccl2 in hepatocytes and M1 marker genes in macrophages. Our results demonstrate that MLL4, through the NF-κB-MLL4 regulatory axis, exacerbates steatohepatitis in the context of an inflammatory response and represents a potential therapeutic target for NASH.",7

Although research focuses on how the accumulation of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations in melanocytes drive melanoma development, how alterations in keratinocytes serve as extrinsic drivers of melanoma initiation and progression is poorly understood. We recently identified keratinocyte desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) as an important mediator of keratinocyte:melanoma crosstalk. Here we address the extent to which Dsg1 loss, which occurs in response to acute environmental stress such as ultraviolet radiation, affects early steps in melanomagenesis. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that paracrine signals from Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes mediate a transcriptional switch from a differentiated to undifferentiated cell state in melanocytes expressing BRAFV600E. Of 221 differentially expressed genes in BRAFV600E cells treated with Dsg1-deficient conditioned media (CM), the laminin superfamily member NTN4/Netrin-4, which inhibits senescence in endothelial cells, stood out. Indeed, while BRAFV600E melanocytes treated with Dsg1-deficient CM showed signs of senescence bypass, knockdown of NTN4 reversed these effects. These results suggest that Dsg1 loss in keratinocytes provides an extrinsic signal to push melanocytes towards oncogenic transformation once an initial mutation has been introduced.",18

PNPLA6-driven choline is supplied from RPE cells to adjacent photoreceptor cells to support their survival. Inhibition of this pathway results in abnormal morphology, proliferation, metabolism, and functions of RPE and photoreceptor cells, and mice with retina-specific PNPLA6 deletion exhibit retinitis pigmentosa-like retinal degeneration. Notably, these abnormalities are entirely rescued by choline supplementation. Thus, PNPLA6 plays an essential role in retinal homeostasis by controlling choline availability for phospholipid recycling and provide a framework for the development of a novel ophthalmic drug target for retinal degeneration.",2

With a view to discover effective treatment options for ARID1A-deficient BC patients, we set out to identify targetable effectors dysregulated consequent to ARID1A deficiency. Integrative analyses of ARID1A depletion in normal organoids and data mining in publicly available datasets revealed upregulation of DNA repair and cell cycle-associated genes consequent to loss of ARID1A and identified CHEK1 (Checkpoint kinase 1) and chromosomal passenger complex member BIRC5 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 5) as therapeutically drug-able candidate molecular effectors. Ex vivo treatment of patient-derived BC tumoroids with clinically advanced small molecule inhibitors targeting CHEK1 or BIRC5 was associated with increased DNA damage signalling and apoptosis, and selectively induced cell death in tumoroids lacking ARID1A protein expression.  Thus, integrating public datasets with patient-derived organoid modelling and ex-vivo drug testing can uncover key molecular effectors and mechanisms of oncogenic transformation, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies. Our data point to ARID1A protein expression as a suitable candidate biomarker for the selection of BC patients responsive to therapies targeting BIRC5 and CHEK1.",40

However, the regulation of Pax5 expression remains elusive. Adaptor Rack1 can interact with multiple transcription factors and modulate their activation and/or stability. Despite that, its role in the transcriptional control of B-cell fates is largely unknown. Here we show that CD19-driven Rack1 deficiency leads to pro-B accumulation and simultaneous reduction of B cells at later developmental stages. The generation of bone marrow chimeras indicates a cell-intrinsic role of Rack1 in B-cell homeostasis. Moreover, Rack1 augments BCR and TLR signaling in mature B cells. Based on diminished CD19 expression upon Rack1 deficiency, further exploration reveals that Rack1 maintains Pax5 protein levels through direct interaction and consequent prevention of Pax5 ubiquitination. Accordingly, Mb1-driven Rack1 deficiency almost completely blocks B-cell development at the pro-B cell stage. Thus, Rack1 regulates B-cell development and function through, at least partially, binding to and stabilizing Pax5.",11

After the initial contact with the pathogen, plants are significantly more resistant to future challenges, even from unrelated pathogens, an event known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In plants polyamines are involved in the regulation and establishment of the defense response by modulating their metabolism, specifically their biosynthesis, conjugation and catabolism. However, it is not known whether polyamine transport is involved in the plant defense response. Herein, we demonstrate that the PUT2/LAT4 transporter is required to establish local immunity and systemic defense responses in the A. thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) pathosystem. Our data revealed a dual phenotype in the put2-1 mutant after Pst inoculation, on one side, SAR was abolished in the systemic leaves while on the other, basal resistance to Pst was enhanced. Remarkably, this phenotype persisted even upon inoculation with unrelated pathogens such as Botrytis cinerea, highlighting a broad-spectrum SAR deficiency. To gain deeper insights into the involvement of PA transport in SAR, transcriptomic and metabolomic data of the put2-1 mutant were obtained.",24

Initially thought to be caused by age-associated accumulation of plaques, in recent years, research has increasingly associated AD with lysosomal storage and metabolic disorders, and the explanation of its pathogenesis has shifted from amyloid and tau accumulation to oxidative stress and impaired lipid and glucose metabolism aggravated by hypoxic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms linking those cellular processes and conditions to disease progression have yet to be defined. Here, we applied a disease similarity approach to identify unknown molecular targets of AD by using transcriptomic data from congenital diseases known to increase AD risk, namely Down Syndrome, Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC), and Mucopolysaccharidoses I. We uncovered common pathways, hub genes, and miRNAs across in vitro and in vivo models of these diseases as potential molecular targets for neuroprotection and amelioration of AD pathology, many of which have never been associated with AD. We then investigated common molecular alterations in brain samples from an NPC disease mouse model by juxtaposing them with brain samples of both human and mouse models of AD. Detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses revealed the NPCmut mouse as a novel, short-lived in vivo model of AD characterized by accelerated brain aging, concluding that the NPCmut mouse model can serve as a potential short-lived in vivo model for AD research and for understanding molecular factors affecting brain aging. This research represents the first comprehensive approach to congenital disease association with neurodegeneration and a new perspective on AD research while highlighting shortcomings and lack of correlation in diverse in vitro models. Considering the lack of an AD mouse model that recapitulates the physiological hallmarks of brain aging, the characterization of a short-lived NPC mouse model will further accelerate the research in these fields and offer a unique model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD from a perspective of accelerated brain aging.",12

Several maternal environmental factors, such as aberrant microbiome, immune activation, and poor nutrition, can influence prenatal brain development. Nevertheless, it is unknown how changes in the prenatal environment instruct the developmental trajectory of infiltrating microglia, which in turn affect brain development and function. Here we show that after maternal immune activation (MIA) microglia from the offspring have a long-lived decrease in immune reactivity (blunting) across the developmental trajectory. The blunted immune response was concomitant with changes in the chromatin accessibility and reduced transcription factor occupancy of the open chromatin. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that MIA does not induce a distinct subpopulation but rather decreases the contribution to inflammatory microglia states. Prenatal replacement of MIA microglia with physiological infiltration of naïve microglia ameliorated the immune blunting and restored a decrease in presynaptic vesicle release probability onto dopamine receptor type-two medium spiny neurons, indicating that aberrantly formed microglia due to an adverse prenatal environment impacts the long-term microglia reactivity and proper striatal circuit development.",39

After many years hard work, we begin to understand how the excitability of VTA DA neurons are regulated, but these achievements are far from satisfactory. Furthermore, with recent progress and realization that property of VTA DA neurons, against the classical view that VTA DA neurons are homogeneous population, are distinctly different, thus the accumulated limited knowledge on the mechanism of excitability modulation of VTA DA neurons is especially short of expectation. The most outstanding indications of the heterogeneity of VTA DA neurons are represented by the distinctly different electrophysiological properties among VTA DA neurons projecting to different brain regions. However the underlying mechanism is not clear.

Examining the effects of heat stress on the molecular mechanism of bovine oocytes can help to better understand their alterations on a transcriptional level and to plan and mitigate those effects. We aimed to study the response of oocytes to seasonal thermal stress.  Materials and Methods: Multiparous angus dry beef cows (n = 11) were kept together during the study and subjected to synchronisation and stimulation of follicular growth using a 5-day CIDR and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) protocol. Ovum pick-up (OPU) was conducted on all animals in the winter (January) and summer (August). Cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were isolated from the follicular fluid aspirated during the OPU procedure. Denuded oocytes were further isolated from the COCs, snap frozen, and stored at −80 °C until further use for library sequencing, RNA sequencing, bioinformatics and gene enrichment analysis. Additionally, rectal temperatures were recorded on the day of each OPU. Environmental data were collected daily three weeks before the day of each OPU using the Florida Automated Weather Network. Statistical analysis for average rectal temperature included overall mean (average rectal temperature), treatment effects (season), and the residual. Treatment effect was considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. RNA was extracted from five biological replicates/pools of oocytes (each containing n = 2) followed by library preparation and sequencing (NovaSeq; Illumina).  Results: As expected, environmental conditions were contrasting [average air temperature (11.5 °C vs 27.5 °C), average max air temperature (16.9 °C vs 33.7 °C), relative humidity (83.5% vs 82.3%), and temperature-humidity index (53.39 vs 79.16) for winter and summer, respectively]. Average rectal temperature was greater (P = 0.03) in summer (39.2 ± 0.2 °C) than in the winter (38.8 ± 0.2 °C). Data analysis revealed an up-regulation of 446 transcripts and a down-regulation of 940 transcripts in oocytes collected during summer compared to winter (Fold Change ≥ 2; FDR P-value ≤ 0.05). Upregulated transcripts are involved in protein digestion and absorption, ATP-binding cassette transporter, oocyte meiosis, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathways. Conversely, down-regulated transcripts are involved in pathways related to extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt signaling.  Conclusions: In conclusion, exposure of cows to thermal stress can significantly alter the transcriptome of oocytes, which may negatively impact subsequent developmental competence.",8

The present study extends previous work describing a high throughput fathead minnow assay that can provide full transcriptomic data after exposure to a test chemical.  One day post-hatch fathead minnows were exposed to ten concentrations of three representatives of four chemical modes of action: organophosphates, ecdysone receptor agonists, plant photosystem II inhibitors, and estrogen receptor agonists for 24 hours.  Concentration response modeling was performed on whole body gene expression data from each exposure, using measured chemical concentrations when available.  Transcriptomic points of departure in larval fathead minnow were lower than apical effect concentrations across fish species but not always lower than toxic effect concentrations in other aquatic taxa like crustaceans and insects.  The point of departure was highly dependent on measured chemical concentration which were often lower than the nominal concentration.  Differentially expressed genes between chemicals within modes of action were compared and often showed statistically significant overlap.  In addition, reproducibility between identical exposures using a positive control chemical (CuSO4) and variability associated with the transcriptomic point of departure using in-silico sampling were considered.  Results extend a transcriptomic-compatible fathead minnow high throughput assay for possible use in ecological hazard screening.",932

As early mammalian development is challenging to study in vivo, stem cell-derived models have emerged as powerful surrogates, e.g. human and mouse gastruloids. However, although single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and high-resolution imaging have been extensively applied to characterize such in vitro embryo models, a paucity of measurements of protein dynamics and regulation leaves a major gap in our understanding. Here we sought to address this by applying quantitative proteomics to human and mouse gastruloids at four key stages of their differentiation (naïve ESCs, primed ESCs, early gastruloids, late gastruloids). To the resulting data, we perform network analysis to map the dynamics of expression of macromolecular protein complexes and biochemical pathways, including identifying cooperative proteins that associate with them. With matched RNA-seq and phosphosite data from these same stages, we investigate pathway-, stage- and species-specific aspects of translational and post-translational regulation, e.g. finding peri-gastrulation stages of human vs. mice to be discordant with respect to the mitochondrial transcriptome vs. proteome, and nominating novel kinase-substrate relationships based on phosphosite dynamics. Finally, we leverage correlated dynamics to identify conserved protein networks centered around congenital disease genes. Altogether, our study showcases the potential of intersecting proteomics and in vitro embryo models to advance our understanding of early mammalian development in ways that may not be possible through transcriptomics alone.",18

"GSE179123","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Study on the mechanism of TSC22D3 regulating the stability of P53 to promote the quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells","In adults, human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are mostly in a quiescent state (G0 stage) and show multilineage reconstruction. When the cell cycle is activated, HSCs gradually lose the hematopoietic reconstruction ability. It indicates that the maintenance of the quiescent state of HSPCs has very important physiological significance. However, the maintenance and regulation mechanism of the quiescent state of HSCs has not yet been clarified. We found that TSC22D3 was highly enriched in quiescent state HSCs but downregulated in culture with the activation of the cell cycle. We further confirmed that stabilizing TSC22D3 expression in HSCs could promote the maintenance of the quiescent state and provide balanced multilineage reconstitution in primary mouse recipients.We found that overexpression of TSC22D3 can promote the maintenance of the resting state of HSCs and the ability of hematopoietic reconstitution by inhibiting the expression of cell cycle-related kinases. Also we confirmed that TSC22D3 can promote the accumulation of p53 protein in cells and up-regulate the expression of p21, p27 and other proteins by qPCR and western blot. Therefore, we speculate that TSC22D3 can promote the resting state of HSCs by regulating the stability of p53. It remains elusive that how TSC22D3 plays a role in the regulation of the maintenance of HSCs in vitro, therefore, further investigations are required to depict its underlying mechanism. On this basis, We firstly plan to analyze the potential downstream targets of TSC22D3 in the maintenance of HSCs in vitro through RNA-seq based transcriptome comparison; then, we will verify the predicted targets of TSC22D3 through Co-IP, gene overexpression, gene knockdown, and signaling pathway activation/inhibition.

However, due to technical and ethical limitations, mechanisms of human gastrulation are largely unexplored. For example, it is generally unclear whether a spatially ordered, external cue is necessary for patterning, or whether the epiblast harbors the innate ability to differentiate and self-organize in the absence of asymmetric cues. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) fortunately offer the potential to model gastrulation, most notably through generation of 3D “gastruloids”.

Initially thought to be caused by age-associated accumulation of plaques, in recent years, research has increasingly associated AD with lysosomal storage and metabolic disorders, and the explanation of its pathogenesis has shifted from amyloid and tau accumulation to oxidative stress and impaired lipid and glucose metabolism aggravated by hypoxic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms linking those cellular processes and conditions to disease progression have yet to be defined. Here, we applied a disease similarity approach to identify unknown molecular targets of AD by using transcriptomic data from congenital diseases known to increase AD risk, namely Down Syndrome, Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC), and Mucopolysaccharidoses I. We uncovered common pathways, hub genes, and miRNAs across in vitro and in vivo models of these diseases as potential molecular targets for neuroprotection and amelioration of AD pathology, many of which have never been associated with AD. We then investigated common molecular alterations in brain samples from an NPC disease mouse model by juxtaposing them with brain samples of both human and mouse models of AD. Detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses revealed the NPCmut mouse as a novel, short-lived in vivo model of AD characterized by accelerated brain aging, concluding that the NPCmut mouse model can serve as a potential short-lived in vivo model for AD research and for understanding molecular factors affecting brain aging. This research represents the first comprehensive approach to congenital disease association with neurodegeneration and a new perspective on AD research while highlighting shortcomings and lack of correlation in diverse in vitro models. Considering the lack of an AD mouse model that recapitulates the physiological hallmarks of brain aging, the characterization of a short-lived NPC mouse model will further accelerate the research in these fields and offer a unique model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD from a perspective of accelerated brain aging.",12

How these different events are coordinated remains unknown. Here, we developed a 3D culture of self-renewing pluripotent and epithelial cells that recapitulates the transcriptional and architectural features of the gastrulating mouse embryo. Using this system in combination with microfabrication and in vivo experiments, we found that proliferation triggers basal extrusion in cells that express high levels of the apical polarity protein aPKC. Upon extrusion, cells are more sensitive to Bmp, Wnt, and Nodal signaling, and upregulate the expression of primitive streak markers. This mechanistic coupling between cell position and gene expression ensures that the right cell types become specified at the right place during embryonic development.",35

Of differentially expressed genes involved in lipid metabolism, PLA2G6, a phospholipase recently associated with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, was downregulated in both LCPUFA groups.  ELOVL5, a PUFA elongase, was the only enzyme in the LCPUFA biosynthetic pathway that was differentially expressed.  Mitochondrial fatty acid carrier, CPT2, was among several genes associated with mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to be downregulated, while the mitochondrial proton carrier, UCP2, was upregulated.  PUFA-regulated receptor, Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) was repressed in both groups, while HNF4A, a PUFA regulated factor, was downregulated in L3/C.  Genes involved in neural development, TIMM8A, NRG1, SEMA3D and NUMB, were upregulated while HES1 and SIM1 showed decreased expression. LUM, EML2, TIMP3 and TTC8 which have roles in visual perception were upregulated and TIA1, a silencer of COX2 gene translation is upregulated in L3/C. Ingenuity network analysis identified a top network associated with nervous system development and function with EGFR as the outstanding interaction partner. In this network EGFR interacts with genes involved in neural or visual perception, TIMP3, NRG1, ADAM17, EDG7 and FGF7. Quantitative real time-PCR analysis on selected genes confirmed the array results. The L and L3 groups have DHA and ARA content within the ranges observed in human and baboon breastmilk, and thus these data indicate that LCPUFA concentrations within the normal range of human breastmilk induce global changes in gene expression across numerous functions including transcripts involved in neural development, visual perception, etc. Keywords: dietary dose response",12

MCL1-M captures both MM cell-intrinsically acting signals and the signals regulating the interaction between MM cells with bone marrow microenvironment. MM can be clustered into MCL1-M high and MCL1-M low subtypes. While the MCL1-M high MMs are enriched in a preplasmablast signature, the MCL1-M low MMs are enriched in B cell-specific genes. In multiple independent datasets, MCL1-M high MMs exhibited poorer prognosis compared to MCL1-M low MMs. Re-analysis of the phase III HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 showed that only MCL1-M MMs, but not MCL1-M low MMs, benefited from bortezomib-based treatment. To translate the MCL1-M clustering scheme into a platform for individual diagnosis, we refined the classifier genes and developed a support vector machine-based algorithm. Individual MMs with transcriptome assessed at the RNA-seq or U133 plus 2.0 array platform can be robustly assigned as the MCL1-M high or low subtype with high confidence. Analyses of the MM samples in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial and APEX trial reinforce that only MCL1-M high MMs benefit from bortezomib-based treatment with a hazard ratio of 0.58 (P = 0.010) and 0.47 (P = 0.009), respectively. Thus, MCL1-M based subtyping assigns MMs into prognostic and predictive molecular subtypes driven by subtype-specific pathogenic pathways.",93

Besides the CTCF/cohesin machinery, only a small set of nuclear factors have been studied for a direct role in physically connecting regulatory elements. Here, we show via acute degradation experiments that LDB1 directly and broadly promotes enhancer-promoter loops. Utilizing multiple degron systems, we demonstrate that most endogenous LDB1-mediated contacts can form in the absence of CTCF, cohesin and YY1. Furthermore, an engineered/forced, LDB1-driven chromatin loop can form in the absence of cohesin. Yet, in a fraction of cases cohesin driven extrusion may promote LDB1 anchored loops. Leveraging the dynamic reorganization of nuclear architecture during the transition from mitosis to G1 phase, we establish a relationship between LDB1-dependent interactions in the context of TAD organization and gene activation. Tri-C and Region Capture Micro-C reveal that LDB1 organizes multi-enhancer networks to activate transcription. This establishes LDB1 as direct driver of connectivity between regulatory elements.",65

We conducted a phase I trial to determine the optimal dose of triplet therapy with sitravatinib plus nivolumab plus ipilimumab in 22 previously untreated patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The primary endpoint was safety. The addition of even a low sitravatinib dose of 35 mg daily to nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg resulted in high frequency of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Subsequent dose reduction of ipilimumab to 0.7 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg allowed safe escalation of sitravatinib up to 100 mg daily. Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Overall, the triplet combination in the dose-finding setting achieved an ORR of 45.5%, DCR of 86.4%, and a median PFS of 14.5 months with 72.7% of patients alive after a median follow-up of 15.7 months. Single-cell RNA-seq performed in longitudinally collected tumor biopsies from 12 patients treated with the triplet therapy identified a tumor cell-specific epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like program associated with treatment resistance and poor outcomes in patients of this trial and in patients of the TCGA ccRCC cohort. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), the emergence of treatment resistance was characterized by a transition from cytotoxic to exhausted T cell state and enrichment for M2-like myeloid cells. The observed changes in gene expression dynamics and cellular states in tumor cell and TME may help inform future strategies to optimize ICT efficacy.",19

Genome‐wide DNA methylation profiling of a cohort of 13 patients with MPNST (29 samples of tumor and adjacent neurofibroma tissues) and of NF1‐MPNST cell lines was performed to identify and validate candidate MPNST‐specific CpG sites (CpGs). A logistic regression prediction model was constructed to select MPNST‐specific CpGs distinct from adjacent neurofibromas and normal tissues. To test if hypermethylation at selected CpGs can also be detected in plasma from patients with MPNST, cfMBD‐seq was applied to profile the cfDNA methylome of blood from patients with MPNST and NF1. Based on stringent feature‐selection criteria and predictive modeling, we identified 73 candidate MPNST‐specific CpGs (67 with unique CpG island locations) that reliably discriminated MPNSTs from neurofibromas. Validation of five candidate biomarkers confirmed successful MPNST detection (sensitivity: > 88%, specificity: > 91%) in tissues. In plasma samples, 63 of 67 selected genomic regions had greater than 1.2‐fold higher methylation in patients with MPNST than those with NF1. Further, we identified 15 CpG islands that consistently separated plasma from patients with confirmed MPNST diagnosis from plasma of individuals with NF1 without a diagnosis of malignant transformation (FDR < 0.1). Our findings confirmed a unique hypermethylation pattern present during malignant transformation. This study highlights the potential to be further investigated further as biomarkers in clinical settings for early MPNST detection in patients with NF1.",43

Transcriptome analysis revealed that LDN-193189 treatment instead of coculturing with feeder cells could help maintain the pluripotency and homogenous cell population of pig ESCs by stimulating the secretion of chemokines and suppressing differentiation. We confirmed that LDN-193189-treated pig ESCs cultured without feeder cells maintained pluripotency for an extended period and were capable of differentiating in vivo and in vitro. The pig ESCs represented distinct characteristics of pig epiblasts as an in vivo counterpart at a transcriptomic level.

Nevertheless, the ultimate fate and functional role of these foam cells remain unclear, while their inflammatory phenotype elicits ongoing controversy. We discovered that macrophages transform into foam cells through 3 stages, which were phagocytosis, digestion, and lipid overload. Macrophages possess a certain degree of antioxidant capacity. When confronted with excessive lipid pressure, they undergo lipid droplets formation and metabolic reprogramming to alleviate lipotoxicity, also promoting angiogenesis. The anti-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages gradually diminished after SCI, phagocytosing debris could assist in maintaining this phenotype. Moreover, most genes expression patterns were conserved both in the SCI mice and rats. Our study provides a detailed description of the changes in gene expression and function during foam cell formation and long-term fate after SCI, which provides a theoretical basis for further research.",48

Among these, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD) are the most widespread ones. However, little is known about the common aspects between these conditions and how these aspects can be linked to aging itself. With this work, we aim to identify a molecular fil rouge that could link aging and different dementias in order to possibly highlight strategic targets for novel therapeutical approaches. A whole transcriptome analysis and a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) have been carried out on brain samples from hippocampus (HI), temporal and parietal cortex (TC, PC), cingulate cortex (CG), and substantia nigra (SN) from the Abbiategrasso Brain Bank (ABB) of subjects with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD and LBD (6 per pathology) and 3 age-matched controls with no dementia (CTRLs). Clinical and neuropsychological profile were obtained through serial evaluations, made at the baseline and in the following years. According to the ABB protocol, the neuropathological diagnosis was based on a complete histological characterization, including all the main proteinopathies and vascular scoring. Transcriptomic results showed some major differences in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two pathologies and in particular that AD brains gene expression is more affected compared to LBD’s one (DEGsAD=3156; DEGsLBD=278). Furthermore, the GSEA showed that in AD it is possible to cluster the analysed regions by biological processes (HI and TC: DEGs primarily related to synaptic transmission; PC, CG and SN: DEGs primarily related to proper protein folding and inflammation) while in LBD there is only a strong and peculiar involvement of SN (DEGs primarily related to proper protein folding and inflammation) and PC (DEGs primarily related to myelination and glial system activation). AD and LBD are different forms of dementia characterized by a definite time and severity-related pattern. Therefore, it is possible to draw a molecular map of pathology spreading in the brain that could unveil unexplored roads and possible shortcuts leading to a better understanding of AD and LBD pathogenesis. This could help to discover novel biological targets in order to develop effective and well-timed therapeutical approaches.",90

"GSE247560","Mus musculus","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase promotes the reprogramming of Sox9+ renal progenitor cells and renal regeneration","Mammalian kidney has very limited ability to repair or regenerate after acute kidney injury (AKI). The maladaptive repair of AKI promotes the progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, it is extremely urgent to explore new strategies to promote the repair/regeneration of injured renal tubules after AKI. It has been shown that hypoxia induces heart regeneration in adult mice. However, it is unknown whether hypoxia can induce kidney regeneration after AKI. In this study, we used a prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitor (PHDI), MK-8617, to mimic hypoxia condition and found that MK-8617 significantly ameliorates ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) induced acute kidney injury. We then showed that MK-8617 dramatically facilitates renal regeneration via promoting the proliferation of injured renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) after IRI-induced AKI. We then performed bulk mRNA sequencing and discovered that multiple nephrogenesis- related genes were significantly upregulated with MK-8617 pretreatment. Furthermore, we showed that MK-8617 may alleviate proximal tubule injury via stabilizing HIF-1α protein specifically in renal proximal tubular cells. We also demonstrated that MK-8617 promotes the reprogramming of renal proximal tubular cells to Sox9+ renal progenitor cells, and the regeneration of renal proximal tubules.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key sensors for exogenous and endogenous signals produced during injury. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether TLRs affect the homeostatic functions of MSCs after injury. Methods: We examined the expression of TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 in MSCs, and analyzed the functional significance of TLR2 activation using single-cell RNA sequencing. Additionally, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of TLR2 and its downstream activation in MSCs on monocytes/macrophages and a mouse model of sterile injury-induced inflammatory corneal angiogenesis.  Results: MSCs expressed TLR2, which was upregulated by monocytes/macrophages. Activation of TLR2 in MSCs promoted their immunoregulatory and angiostatic functions in monocytes/macrophages and in mice with inflammatory corneal angiogenesis, whereas TLR2 inhibition attenuated these functions. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed AKR1C1, a gene encoding aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1, as the most significantly inducible gene in MSCs upon TLR2 stimulation, though its stimulation did not affect cell compositions. AKR1C1 protected MSCs against ferroptosis, increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced their ability to drive monocytes/macrophages towards immunoregulatory phenotypes, leading to amelioration of inflammatory corneal neovascularization in mice.  Conclusion: Our findings suggest that activation of TLR2-AKR1C1 signaling in MSCs serves as an important pathway for MSCs’ survival and homeostatic activities during injury.",2

The in vitro activity map mirrored phylogenetic sequence conservation in glmS ribozymes, indicating that biological fitness reports all biochemically important positions. Most deleterious mutations impaired RNA self-assembly. All-atom MD simulations of the complete ribozyme revealed how individual mutations in the core or the IL4 peripheral loop rewire the network of hydrogen bonds around the catalytic site. Remarkably, IL4 mutations introduce a non-native helix interface that corrupts folding of the wild type core, eliminating activity.

Transcriptome profiling has helped to characterize both primary tumors seeding nodal metastasis and the metastasis themselves. The interpretation of these data, however, is not without ambiguities. Here we profiled the transcriptomes of 17 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) nodal metastases, associated primary tumors and primary tumors from N0 patients. We also included patient-matched normal thyroid and lymph node samples as controls to address some limits of previous studies. We found that the transcriptomes of patient-matched primary tumors and metastases were more similar than of unrelated metastases/primary pairs, a result also reported in other organ systems, and that part of this similarity reflected patient background. We found that the comparison of patient-matched primary tumors and metastases was heavily confounded by the presence of lymphoid tissues in the metastasis samples. An original data adjustment procedure was developed to circumvent this problem. It revealed a differential expression of stroma-related gene expression signatures also regulated in other organ systems. The comparison of N0 vs. N+ primary tumors uncovered a signal irreproducible across independent PTC datasets. This signal was also detectable when comparing the normal thyroid tissues adjacent to N0 and N+ tumors, suggesting a cohort specific bias also likely to be present in previous studies with similar statistical power. Classification of N0 vs. N+ yielded an accuracy of 63%, but additional statistical controls not presented in previous studies, revealed that this is likely to occur by chance alone. To address this issue, we used large datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and showed that N0 vs. N+ classification rates could not be reached randomly for most cancers. Yet, it was significant, but of limited accuracy (<70%) for thyroid, breast and head and neck cancers.",92

Swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) are common in the elderly and in many adult-onset neuromuscular diseases. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), dysphagia is often the first symptom. OPMD is an autosomal dominant myopathy caused by a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the gene encoding PABPN1. The expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble nuclear aggregates that reduce the levels of the soluble form. Clinical tongue involvement in OPMD has been documented but is poorly understood. Tongue histopathology was investigated in OPMD mouse models using light and electron microscopy. Muscle histopathology was predominantly affected by age. PABPN1 nuclear aggregates were found at moderate levels, whereas deposition of insoluble PABPN1 in blood vessels was already prominent in 4-month-old mice. RNA signatures of the OPMD tongue were enriched for mitochondrial and cytoskeletal genes, suggesting an energy and contractile deficit.  ",8

Phenotypes of anoikis resistant cancer cells have been extensively investigated, however, how exposure to suspension stress may lead to acquisition of a anoikis resistance phenotype has not been previously described in detail.  Here we show using a spectrum of ovarian cancer cells, that cycles of suspension stress followed by attached growth, leads to adaptation and acquisition of resistance to cell death in suspension . Comparing the stepwise transcriptomic changes as cells acquire resistance, we find strong transcriptional reprogramming in the population with a majority of differentially expressed genes being downregulated during progressive acquisition of anoikis resistance. Adapted anoikis resistant cells display an enhanced dependency on oxidative phosphorylation and are capable of evasion from T cell-mediated immune surveillance. We find that such acquired anoikis resistance is not genetic. However, transcriptional reprogramming is essential to this process as acquisition of such adaptive anoikis resistance invitro and invivo are both exquisitely sensitive to specific inhibition of transcriptional reprogramming. Our data demonstrate that recovery from the verge of anoikis leads to adaptation that promotes metastasis in ovarian cancer, but can be therapeutically prevented by specific inhibitors to transcriptional reprogramming.",34

Among them, the LRRK2 Gly2019Ser is the most common PD-associated mutation. It is unknown how LRRK2 mutation affects intestinal inflammation susceptibility or pathogenesis of PD.

We found a cell-intrinsic function for LRRK2 G2019S in vivo, in increasing neutrophil chemotaxis, degranulation and NETosis, and an upregulation of Th17 immune responses, which may together contribute to the observed increased colon pathology. Transcriptionally, these neutrophils have a greater pro-inflammatory type I and II IFN response compared to WT mice.

Inactivation of upstream activators of the Hippo pathway in lung stem cells inhibits this tonic β-catenin signaling and Myc expression and promotes their Taz-mediated differentiation into AT1 cells. Vice versa, increased Myc in collaboration with Yap promotes the differentiation of lung stem cells along the basal and myoepithelial like lineages allowing them to invade and bronchiolize the lung parenchyma in a process reminiscent of submucosal gland development. Our findings indicate that stem cells exhibiting the highest Myc levels become supercompetitors that drive remodeling, whereas loser cells with lower Myc levels terminally differentiate into AT1 cells",5

However, the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 proteinopathy are still largely unknown. We performed in vitro differentiation of ALS-induced pluripotent stem cells (ALS-iPSCs; carrying the TDP-43M337V mutation) and isogenic controls and found upregulation of paraspeckle-associated lncRNA NEAT1 isoforms in the ALS-iPSC-derived MNs (ALS-iPSC-MNs). Intriguingly, the upregulated NEAT1 isoforms were mislocalized to the cytoplasm of ALS-iPSC-MNs, and the cytoplasmic NEAT1 provoked TDP-43 and TDP-43M337V liquid-liquid phase separation, generating long-lived protein condensates. These condensates had reduced mobility and were converted into aggregates, finally co-aggregating with phospho-TDP-43. Disruption of NEAT1 expression reduced its cytoplasmic levels and also reduced the levels of TDP-43/TDP-43M337V condensates. In 3D neuromuscular organoids with the TDP-43M337V mutation, treatment with NEAT1-antisense oligonucleotides (NEAT1-ASO) promoted neuromuscular junction formation and function, as well as muscle contractility. Furthermore, treatment of TDP-43Q331K mice with Neat1-ASO attenuated TDP-43 pathology in spinal cord and preserved motor function.

The impact of loss of ATF6 function on other cell types, organs, and diseases in people remains unclear. Here, we reported that progressive sensorineural hearing loss was a notable complaint in some patients carrying ATF6 disease alleles and that Atf6-/- mice also showed progressive auditory deficits affecting both genders.

Temporal assessment comparing GCs from mice with chronic infection or lupus revealed a shared accumulation of LZ B cells while lupus GC B cells had a unique reduction in proliferation and a progressive loss of MYC and FOXO1 in lupus. This loss in proliferative capacity coincided with a reduction in B cell receptor repertoire diversity and mutational burden. Furthermore, we identified persistent dominant GC B cell clones associated with an expansion in plasma cell differentiation throughout disease.

Alongside clinical risk factors, genetic variants contribute to CIO and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted the polygenicity of this adverse drug reaction. Polygenic scores (PGS), which integrate information from multiple genetic variants across the genome, offer a promising tool for the identification of individuals who are at higher risk for CIO. Integrating large-scale hearing loss GWAS data with single cell omics data holds potential to overcome limitations related to small sample sizes associated with CIO studies, enabling the creation of PGSs to predict CIO risk. Results We utilized a large-scale hearing loss GWAS and murine inner ear single nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data to develop two polygenic scores: a hearing loss PGS (PGSHL) and a biologically informed PGS for CIO (PGSCIO). The PGSCIO included only variants which mapped to genes that were differentially expressed within cochlear cells that showed differential abundance in the murine snRNA-seq data post-cisplatin treatment. Evaluation of the association of these PGSs with CIO in our target CIO cohort revealed that PGSCIO demonstrated superior performance (P = 5.54 × 10− 5) relative to PGSHL (P = 2.93 × 10− 3). PGSCIO was also associated with CIO in our test cohort (P = 0.04), while the PGSHL did not show a significant association with CIO (P = 0.52). Conclusion This study developed the first PGS for CIO using a large-scale hearing loss dataset and a biologically informed filter generated from cisplatin-treated murine inner ear snRNA-seq data. This innovative approach offers new avenues for developing PGSs for pharmacogenomic traits, which could contribute to the implementation of tailored therapeutic interventions. Further, our approach facilitated the identification of specific cochlear cells that may play critical roles in CIO.

The APOE ε2 encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE2) is a protective allele against AD among the three genotypes (APOE ε2, ε3, ε4), while APOE4 is the strongest genetic factor substantially increasing AD risk. APOE regulates brain lipid homeostasis and maintaining synaptic plasticity and neuronal function, where APOE2 has a superior function compared to APOE3 and APOE4. Gene therapy that increases APOE2 levels in the brain is, therefore, a promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. We previously reported that PEGylated liposomes conjugated with transferrin and a cell-penetrating peptide Penetratin sufficiently deliver chitosan-APOE2 cDNA plasmid complex into the brain of wild-type mice. Here, we investigated how brain-targeting liposome-based APOE2 gene delivery influences Aβ)-related pathologies in amyloid model AppNL-G-F knockin mice at 12-month-old. We found a trend of reductions of insoluble Aβ levels in the mouse cortices 1 month after APOE2 gene therapy. Furthermore, in the AppNL-G-F knockin mice that received the APOE2 gene therapy, brain transcriptome analysis through RNA-sequencing identified the upregulation of genes/pathways related to neuronal development. This was supported by increases of Dlg4 and Syp mRNAs coding synaptic proteins in the experimental group. On the other hand, we found that APOE2 gene delivery increased soluble Aβ levels, including oligomers, as well as exacerbated neurite dystrophy and decreased synaptophysin. Together, our results suggest that brain-targeting liposome-based APOE2 gene therapy is potentially beneficial for synaptic formation at the transcriptional level. Forced APOE2 expressions, however, may exacerbate Aβ toxicity by increasing the dissociation of Aβ oligomers from aggregates in the presence of considerable amyloid burden.",23

Intriguingly, our recent research uncovers a disrupted heme biosynthesis process termed 'Porphyrin Overdrive' in cancers, fostering the accumulation of heme intermediates, potentially bolstering tumor survival. Here, we investigate heme and porphyrin metabolism in both healthy and oncogenic human livers, utilizing primary human liver transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Our investigations unveil robust gene expression patterns in heme biosynthesis in healthy livers, supporting electron transport chain (ETC) and cytochrome P450 function, devoid of intermediate accumulation. Conversely, liver cancers exhibit impaired heme biosynthesis and massive downregulation of cytochrome P450 expression. Notably, despite diminished drug metabolism, heme supply to the ETC remains largely unaltered or even elevated with cancer progression, suggesting a metabolic priority shift. Liver cancers selectively accumulate intermediates, absent in normal tissues, implicating their role in disease advancement as inferred by expression.

Immunohistochemically, all neoplasms stained with CD34, while S100 was positive in 2/14. EGFR expression was observed in 9/10 cases. Molecularly, the IFS and one LFT harbored EGFR-KDD, while an exon 20 mutation was identified in all FHI, one LFT and in the DFSP and predominantly myxoid spindle cell lesion. By DNAmp, all but two cases formed a well-defined cluster, demonstrating that these lesions are also epigenetically related. In conclusion, EGFR kinase domain aberrations found in FHI, IFS, LFN, DFSP and a spindle cell lesion with a predominant myxoid stroma of children and adolescents show that these neoplasms with a broad morphological spectrum belong to the group of protein kinase-related lesions with a distinct epigenetic signature. Molecular analyses, including DNAmp, help to identify and characterize this emerging category and become mandatory when targeted treatment is considered.",14
"GSE263829","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Porphyrin overdrive rewires cancer cell metabolism","All cancer cells reprogram metabolism to support aberrant growth. Here, we report that cancer cells employ and depend on imbalanced and dynamic heme metabolic pathways, to accumulate heme intermediates, i.e., porphyrins. We coined this essential metabolic rewiring ‘porphyrin overdrive’ and determined that it is cancer-essential and cancer-specific. Among the major drivers are genes encoding mid-step enzymes governing the production of heme intermediates. CRISPR/Cas9 editing to engineer leukemia cell lines with impaired heme biosynthetic steps confirmed our whole genomic data analyses that porphyrin overdrive is linked to oncogenic states and cellular differentiation. While porphyrin overdrive is absent in differentiated cells or somatic stem cells, it is present in patient-derived tumor progenitor cells, demonstrated by single cell RNAseq, and in early embryogenesis. In conclusion, we identified a dependence of cancer cells on non-homeostatic heme metabolism, and we targeted this cancer metabolic vulnerability with a novel “bait-and-kill” strategy to eradicate malignant cells.",1

We applied  DNA methylation (DNAm) and copy number variation (CNV) profiling to characterize 241 pBT samples, including 155 tumors and 86 pBT-derived cell cultures, and considering serum vs serum-free conditions, late vs early passages, and dimensionality (2D vs 3D cultures). We performed a t-SNE classification and identified differentially methylated regions in tumors compared to cell models.    Early cell cultures recapitulate the original tumor, but serum media and 2D culturing were demonstrated to significant contribute to the divergence of DNAm profiles from the parental ones. All divergent cells clustered together acquiring a common deregulated epigenetic signature, suggesting a shared selective pressure.

Here, by isolating five subcellular components of hESCs and differentiated cells, we uncovered the global subcellular RNA localization in hESC. For protein-coding mRNA, different transcripts of the same gene exhibit an “isoform switch” between subcellular components, which is regulated by localization cis-elements in their variable regions. For noncoding RNA, multiple sequence features such as polyA tail, length, and GC content jointly regulate their subcellular localization. In addition, we found that some developmental genes can be transcribed in advance and confined to chromatin in undifferentiated hESCs. Finally, we revealed significant changes in overall RNA distribution, mapped RNA dynamic localization atlas, and characterized different dynamic RNA localization patterns during hESC differentiation into mesoderm. The multiple RNA localization patterns we revealed will provide some new enlightenment for hESC stemness maintenance and differentiation.",40

Anterograde regulatory pathways involving a large number of nuclear-encoded proteins control mitochondrial biogenesis and functions. Such functions are deregulated in cancer, resulting in proliferative advantages for cancer cells, aggressive disease and therapeutic resistance. Transcriptional networks controlling the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are known, however alternative splicing (AS) regulation has not been implicated in this communication. Here, we show that IQGAP1, a scaffold protein that regulates AS of distinct gene subsets in gastric cancer cells, participates in AS regulation that strongly affects mitochondrial respiration. Combined proteomic and RNA-seq analyses of IQGAP1KO and parental cells show that IQGAP1KO alters a specific AS event of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (CI) subunit NDUFS4 and downregulates a subset of CI subunits. In IQGAP1KO cells, CI intermediates accumulate resembling assembly deficiencies observed in patients with Leigh syndrome bearing NDUFS4 mutations. Mitochondrial CI activity is significantly lower in KO compared to parental cells, while exogenous expression of IQGAP1 reverses mitochondrial defects of IQGAP1KO cells. Our work sheds light to a novel facet of IQGAP1 in mitochondrial quality control that involves fine-tuning of CI activity through AS regulation in gastric cancer.",6

Here we characterize GNPTAB-knockout DAOY medulloblastoma cells using different genetic and proteomic approaches, with a focus on how altered gene expression and cell surface abundance of glycoproteins may explain emerging neurological issues in individual with mucolipidosis (ML). The two knockout clones that were characterized demonstrated all the biochemical hallmarks of this disease, including loss of intracellular glycosidase activity due to impaired mannose 6-phosphate-dependent lysosomal sorting, lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, and increased markers of autophagic dysfunction.  RNA sequencing identified altered transcript abundance of several neuronal markers and genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, and neurodegeneration-related pathways.  Using selective exo-enzymatic labeling (SEEL) coupled with proteomics to profile cell surface glycoproteins, we demonstrated altered abundance of several glycoproteins in the knockout cells.  Most striking was increased abundance of the amyloid precursor protein and apolipoprotein B, indicating that loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase function in these cells corresponds with elevation in proteins associated with neurodegeneration.

Recently, programmable RNA pseudouridylation has emerged as a new type of RNA base editor to suppress PTCs. However, current methods suffer from low efficiency and limited precision. Here, we develop RESTART v3, an updated version of RESTART, which utilizes near-cognate tRNAs to improve the readthrough efficiency of pseudouridine-modified PTCs. We show an average of ~5-fold higher editing efficiency than RESTART v2 in cultured cells, currently the most active RNA pseudouridylation tool to mediate PTC readthrough. Moreover, RESTART v3 achieves functional PTC readthrough in disease cell models of cystic fibrosis and Hurler syndrome. Furthermore, RESTART v3 enables accurate incorporation of the original amino acid for nearly half of the PTC sites, considering the naturally occurring frequencies of sense to nonsense codons. In line with the benign off-target effect of RESTART, RESTART v3 does not change the coding information nor the expression level of transcripts with off-target editing; except for the specifically overexpressed tRNA molecule, it does not alter the expression level of endogenous tRNA pool.

Subtypes of MPS III are caused by deficiencies in one of four enzymes required for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). An inability to degrade HS leads to progressive neurodegeneration and death in the second or third decades of life. Knowledge of MPS III pathogenesis is incomplete, and no effective therapies exist. We generated the hypomorphic mutations sgshS387Lfs, nagluA603Efs and hgsnatG577Sfsin the endogenous zebrafish genes orthologous to human SGSH, NAGLU, and HGSNAT that are loci for mutations causing MPS III subtypes MPS IIIA, B and C respectively. Our models display the primary MPS III disease signature of significant brain accumulation of HS, while behavioural analyses support hyperactivity phenotypes. Brain transcriptome analysis revealed changes related to lysosomal, glycosaminoglycan, immune system and iron homeostasis biology in all three models but also distinct differences in brain transcriptome state between models. The transcriptome analysis also indicated marked disturbance of the oligodendrocyte cell state in the brains of MPS IIIA, B and C zebrafish, supporting that effects on this cell type are an early and consistent characteristic of MPS III.

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the gradual cognitive worsening of this age-related disorder is partially due to dysfunction of the ELP. However, AD is a complex disorder and how the genetic landscape eventually leads to AD is unclear. Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia (mucopolysaccharidosis type III, MPSIII) is an extreme consequence of ELP dysfunction, where inherited recessive mutations result in the inability to properly catabolise a particular polysaccharide, which ultimately accumulates and interferes with the function of the ELP. Unlike AD, Sanfilippo is genetically simple (all causative genes are identified). The primary biochemical consequences are understood and animal models of Sanfilippo are considered excellent models of the human disease. Since Sanfilippo and AD show similar pathological changes, they likely share disease-associated mechanisms. Here, we dissect the similarity between AD and Sanfilippo using RNA-seq. We have generated zebrafish knock-in models of both diseases: the early-onset familial AD-like (EOfAD-like) mutation psen1 Q96_K97del  and the MPSIII-like mutation naglu A603fs. We generated a family of zebrafish containing wild type, heterozygous EOfAD-like and homozygous MPSIII-like genotypes. We raised the family until 7 days post fertilisation and performed mRNA-seq on n = 8 induvial larvae per genotype. A power calculation revealed that this experiment was only contained ~50% power to detect differentially expressed genes.

Patients with MPS VII exhibit progressive skeletal deformity including kyphoscoliosis and joint dysplasia, which decrease quality of life and increase mortality. Previously, using the naturally-occurring canine model, we demonstrated that one of the earliest skeletal abnormalities to manifest in MPS VII is failed initiation of secondary ossification in vertebrae and long bones at the requisite postnatal developmental stage. The objective of this study was to obtain global insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this failed initiation of secondary ossification using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Epiphyseal tissue was isolated from the vertebrae of control and MPS VII affected dogs at 9 and 14 days-of-age (n=5 for each group). Differences in global gene expression across this developmental window for both cohorts were established using RNA-Seq. A targeted analysis focused on signaling pathways important in the regulation of endochondral ossification, and a subset of gene expression changes were validated using qPCR. Principal Component Analysis revealed clustering of samples from each group, indicating clear effects of both age and disease state. At 9 days-of-age, 1375 genes were significantly differentially expression between MPS VII and control, and by 14 days-of-age, this increased to 4719 genes. Osteoactivin (GPNMB) was the top upregulated gene in MPS VII at both ages. Targeted analysis revealed temporal changes in gene expression from 9 to 14 days-of-age in control samples consistent with chondrocyte maturation, cartilage resorption, and osteogenesis.

Although an enzyme replacement therapy is available, the efficacy for the treatment of neuropathic symptoms is limited. To facilitate drug discovery and model disease pathophysiology, we have generated neural stem cells (NSCs) from MPS I patient-derived iPSCs. NSCs exhibited characteristic disease phenotypes with deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and enlargement of lysosomes, correlating with the severity of clinical symptoms. Transcriptome profiling of NSCs revealed differential expression of 429 genes that changed more extensively in the more severe Hurler syndrome subgroup compared to the Hurler-Scheie (median severe) and Scheie (less severe) subgroups. Clustering and pathway analyses demonstrated high concordance of the severity of neurological defects with marked dysregulation of GAG biosynthesis and degradation, lysosomal function and extracellular matrix. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis identified a dramatic upregulation of autophagy pathway, especially in the Hurler syndrome. Thus, GAG accumulation in the patient cells disrupts lysosomal homeostasis affecting multiple related cellular pathways which compensates for IDUA deficiency.

While bone matrix-mobilized growth factors, such as TGF-β, are proposed to regulate remodeling, no in vivo evidence exists that an osteoclast-produced molecule is the enigmatic coupling factor.  We have identified Cthrc1, a protein secreted by mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts, that targets stromal cells so as to stimulate osteogenesis.  The expression of Cthrc1 is robustly induced when mature osteoclasts are placed on dentin or hydroxyapatite, and also by increasing extracellular calcium.  Cthrc1 expression in bone increases in a high turnover state, such as that which is induced by RANKL injections in vivo, whereas it decreases with aging or following alendronate treatment, conditions associated with suppressed bone turnover.  The targeted deletion of the Cthrc1 gene eliminates Cthrc1 expression in bone, whereas its deficiency in osteoblasts does not exert any significant effect.  Osteoclast-specific deletion of the Cthrc1 gene results in osteopenia due to reduced bone formation: it also impairs the coupling process following resorption induced by RANKL injections, with a resultant impairment of bone mass recovery.  Thus, Cthrc1 is an osteoclast-secreted “coupling factor” that regulates bone remodeling and hence, skeletal integrity.",4

Research on genomic evolution and microbial symbiosis has shed light on how these species thrive in extreme deep-sea conditions. However, early adaptation stages, particularly the roles of conserved genes and symbiotic microbes, remain inadequately understood. This study examined transcriptomic and microbiome changes in shallow-water mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to deep-sea conditions at the Site-F cold seep in the South China Sea. Results reveal complex gene expression adjustments in stress response, immune defense, homeostasis, and energy metabolism pathways during adaptation. After 10 days of deep-sea exposure, shallow-water mussels and their microbial communities closely resembled those of native deep-sea mussels, demonstrating host and microbiome convergence in response to adaptive shifts. Notably, methanotrophic bacteria, key symbionts in native deep-sea mussels, emerged as a dominant group in the exposed mussels. Host genes involved in immune recognition and endocytosis correlated significantly with the abundance of these bacteria. Overall, our analyses provide insights into adaptive transcriptional regulation and microbiome dynamics of mussels in deep-sea environments, highlighting the roles of conserved genes and microbial community shifts in adapting to extreme environments.",15

Although many studies have elucidated the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epigenetic regulatory mechanism from NAFL to NASH remains incompletely understood. The histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, MLL4 (also called KMT2D), is a critical epigenetic transcriptional coactivator that mediates overnutrition-induced steatosis in mice, but its potential role in the progression of NASH remains largely unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking the one allele of the Mll4 gene are resistant to hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH conditions compared to wild-type controls. Transcriptome analysis of the livers of control and Mll4+/- mice identified pro-inflammatory genes regulated by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway as major target genes of MLL4. We show that MLL4 binds to p65 and that MLL4 is required for NF-κB transactivation. Myeloid-specific Mll4 knockout mice showed an almost complete block of NASH, while hepatocyte-specific Mll4 knockout mice showed mild inhibition of steatosis. Pro-inflammatory M1 polarization is decreased and anti-inflammatory M2 polarization is increased in liver macrophages from myeloid-specific Mll4 knockout mice. Importantly, we show that histone H3-lysine 4 methylation mediated by the MLL4-complex plays a critical role in promoting the expression of Ccl2 in hepatocytes and M1 marker genes in macrophages. Our results demonstrate that MLL4, through the NF-κB-MLL4 regulatory axis, exacerbates steatohepatitis in the context of an inflammatory response and represents a potential therapeutic target for NASH.",7

Here we characterize GNPTAB-knockout DAOY medulloblastoma cells using different genetic and proteomic approaches, with a focus on how altered gene expression and cell surface abundance of glycoproteins may explain emerging neurological issues in individual with mucolipidosis (ML). The two knockout clones that were characterized demonstrated all the biochemical hallmarks of this disease, including loss of intracellular glycosidase activity due to impaired mannose 6-phosphate-dependent lysosomal sorting, lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, and increased markers of autophagic dysfunction.  RNA sequencing identified altered transcript abundance of several neuronal markers and genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, and neurodegeneration-related pathways.  Using selective exo-enzymatic labeling (SEEL) coupled with proteomics to profile cell surface glycoproteins, we demonstrated altered abundance of several glycoproteins in the knockout cells.  Most striking was increased abundance of the amyloid precursor protein and apolipoprotein B, indicating that loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase function in these cells corresponds with elevation in proteins associated with neurodegeneration.

During maternal immune activation (MIA), the maternal body must balance its ressources between mounting an immune response and investing resources into continued metabolism and growth, essentials for survival of the fetus and a successful pregnancy. How the placenta responds to MIA over time and how it can protect the fetus is not well understood, and neither are the fetal consequences of MIA. Here, we characterised the response to acute maternal lung inflammation across time in maternal and fetal organs, using a combination of omics, imaging and integrative computational analyses. We found that the placenta, unlike other maternal organs, did not react by a typical innate immune response, but instead induced genes associated with increased tissue integrity,  likely to prevent fetal exposure to potential infections, and simultaneously reduced expression of growth-associated genes. Subsequently, a return to homeostasis was observed, with heightened expression of biosynthesis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes. These responses likely protect the fetus from inflammation, as we observed no immune response in the fetal liver transcriptome. Instead, we observed metabolic adaptations in the fetus, including a release of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) carrying metabolites, including triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine. Notably, DHA is crucial for fetal brain development. This metabolic response is likely a combination of the placental MIA response and temporary maternal fasting, caused by MIA-induced fever and lack of nutrient intake. Our study shows, for the first time, the integrated temporal and systemic response to LPS in lungs across maternal and fetal organs",413

However, its efficacy is often limited due to the progressive differentiation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells into a hypofunctional state known as terminal exhaustion. Despite identifying CD8+ T cell subsets associated with immunotherapy resistance, the molecular pathway triggering the resistance remains elusive. Given the clear association of CD38 with CD8+ T cell subsets resistant to anti-PD1 therapy, we investigated its role in inducing resistance. Phenotypic and functional characterization, along with single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of both in vitro chronically stimulated and intratumoral CD8+ T cells, revealed that CD38-expressing CD8+ T cells are terminally exhausted. Exploring the molecular mechanism, we discovered that CD38 expression was crucial in promoting terminal differentiation of CD8+ T cells by suppressing TCF1 expression, thereby rendering them unresponsive to anti-PD1 therapy. Genetic ablation of CD38 in tumor reactive CD8+ T cells restored TCF1 levels and improved the responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy in mice. Mechanistically, CD38 expression on exhausted CD8+ T cells elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels through RyR2 calcium channel activation. This, in turn, promoted chronic AKT activation, leading to TCF1 loss. Knockdown of RyR2 or inhibition of AKT in CD8+ T cells maintained TCF1 levels, induced a sustained anti-tumor response, and enhanced responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy. Thus, targeting CD38 represents a potential strategy to improve the efficacy of anti-PD1 treatment in cancer.",1

Inhibiting glymphatic clearance abolished the removal of amyloid by multisensory 40 Hz stimulation.

Further understanding of the role of striatal subregions in reward behaviors and their potential associations with OUD requires molecular identification of specific striatal cell types in human brain. The human striatum contains subregions based on different anatomical, functional, and physiological properties, with the dorsal striatum further divided into caudate and putamen. Both caudate and putamen are associated with alterations in reward processing, formation of habits, and development of negative affect states in OUD. Using single nuclei RNA-sequencing of human postmortem caudate and putamen, we identified canonical neuronal cell types in striatum (e.g., dopamine receptor 1 or 2 expressing neurons, D1 or D2) and less abundant subpopulations, including D1/D2 hybrid neurons and multiple classes of interneurons. By comparing unaffected subjects to subjects with OUD, we found neuronal-specific differences in pathways related to neurodegeneration, interferon response, and DNA damage. DNA damage markers were also elevated in striatal neurons of rhesus macaques following chronic opioid administration. We identified sex-dependent differences in the expression of stress-induced transcripts (e.g., FKBP5) among astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from female subjects with OUD.

Here, we have used clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) as a model to characterise the mechanisms that underlie lineage factor dependence in cancer. Through CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screening and functional validation we find that loss of SMARCB1, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, can confer an advantage to ccRCC cells upon inhibition of the essential renal lineage factor PAX8. PAX8 inhibition resistant cells formed tumours with a dramatically altered histology showing neuroendocrine differentiation. Based on ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis, SMARCB1 inactivation leads to large-scale loss of kidney-specific epigenetic programmes, acquisition of a cellular state resembling that of rhabdoid tumours, and eventual activation of proliferative pathways. We show that these pathways are supported by the adoption of new transcriptional dependencies on IRF2, BHLHE40, and ZNFX1, factors that represent rare essential genes across different lineage-specific and oncogenic pathways, a principle validated in a large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screening data set comprising hundreds of cancer cell lines. Thus, lineage factor requirements in cancer can switch upon challenge. The rules governing such lineage switching should be considered when designing novel lineage factor-targeted cancer therapies.",24

A growing number of studies advocate for the balanced dietary supplements of n3- and n6-PUFA to maximize the brain functions. Our objective was to probe the implication of PUFA to ameliorate social stress (SS). Mice were fed a customized n-3 PUFA-enriched diet (ERD, n3:n6= 7:1), a balanced diet (BLD, n3:n6= 1:1) or a standard lab diet (STD, n3:n6= 1:6). Past reports linked these diets to brain transcriptomic regulations; hence, we aimed to investigate the effects of these diets on mice exposed to Aggressor-exposed SS (Agg-E SS) model. Mice randomly encountered life-threatening trauma from conspecific aggressor for 10 consecutive days. Stressed mice on STD showed multiple behavioral deficits that lingered even 6 weeks post-Agg-E SS. In comparison, ERD and BLD elevated bodyweights but potentially triggered behavioral resilience to SS. Comprehensive mapping of the behavioral traits projected a diet-specific variance, which was mirrored by the brain transcriptomic readouts. We focused on those brain transcriptomic networks that were exclusively perturbed by the cumulative effects of Diet, Stress and Time. STD adversely affected the gene networks associated with the cell mortality, energy homeostasis and neurodevelopment disorder; however, BLD showed long-term benefits in regulating these gene networks. Further titration of PUFA supplements in daily diets can reduce the adverse effects caused by unbalanced supplement of PUFA without compromising their health benefits.",58

There have been no available treatments and FDA approved drugs for treating NPC. SAHA, a HDAC inhibitor (HDACi), was shown to ameliorate NPC disease phenotypes and considered as a therapeutics candidate but its mechanism of action is not fully clarified yet. Here, we investigated whether SAHA and HNHA, a new derivative of SAHA, reduced cholesterol level and then performed NGS analysis for these two compounds in NPC-iNSCs. Intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport factors were highly enriched by two compounds treatment in NPC-iNSCs. Notably, SNAP25, a subunit of SNARE complex was significantly upregulated. Since autophagic flux is impaired in NPC cells due to SNARE complex deficiency, we hypothesized that increasing SNAP25 could contribute to form autolysosomes. When SNAP25 was overexpressed in NPC cells, it compensated deficient Vamp8-SNAP29-STX17 complexes to Vamp8-SNAP25-STX17 complexes then it restores autolysosomes leading to reduce accumulated LC3, LAMP1a, and p62. Consistently, SNAP25 was upregulated by HDAC inhibitors treatment and recovered deficient autophagic flux in vitro, and in vivo. Therefore, upregulation of SNAP25 by HDAC inhibition ameliorated NPC phenotypic and behavioral disorder in 2D culture system and NPC-/- mouse model.

However, our understanding of the relationships between LSC and pre-leukemic cells is still incomplete. In particular, it is not known whether “niche-anchoring” of pre-leukemic cell affects disease evolution. To address this issue, we conditionally inactivated the adhesion molecule Jam-C expressed by haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and LSC in an inducible iMLL-AF9-driven AML mouse model. Deletion of Jam-C in HSC before activation of the leukemia-initiating iMLL-AF9 fusion resulted in a shift from long term (LT-HSC) to short term-HSC (ST-HSC) expansion, suggesting that transcriptional programs of leukemic HSC were altered. RNA sequencing performed on leukemic HSC and GMP isolated from diseased mice revealed that genes upregulated in Jam-C-deficient animals belonged to Activation Protein-1 (AP-1) and TNF-/NFB signalling pathways. Using three publicly available datasets of AML gene expression, we further showed that human orthologs of dysregulated genes belonged to a gene regulon distinct from the LSC-17 signature. A prognosis 14-genes score from the AP-1/TNF-/NFB gene expression signature was established and called ATIC for “AP-1/TNF- initiating cell”.  ATIC was independent of the LSC-17 score and improved the stratification of AML patients obtained with the LSC-17 score suggesting that the ATIC score reflected the presence of ST-HSC-initiating AML cells at diagnosis.

Indeed, mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) or PS2 are a major cause of early onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD). However, PS proteins also exert multiple functions beyond Aβ generation. In this study, we examine the individual roles of PS1 and PS2 in cellular cholesterol metabolism. Deletion of PS1 or PS2 in mouse models led to cholesterol accumulation in cerebral neurons. Cholesterol accumulation was also observed in lysosomes of embryonic fibroblasts from PS1-KO and PS2-KO mice, and associated with decreased expression of the Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein involved in intracellular cholesterol transport at late endosome/lysosome. Mass spectrometry and complementary biochemical methods also revealed abnormal N-glycosylation of NPC1 and several other membrane proteins in PS1-KO and PS2-KO cells. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of N-glycosylation resulted in intracellular cholesterol accumulation prominently in lysosomes as well as decrease of NPC1 expression in wild-type MEFs, thereby resembling the changes in PS1-KO and PS2-KO MEFs. In turn, treatment of PS1-KO and PS2-KO MEFs with a chaperone inducer, Arimoclomol, attenuated decrease of NPC1 and rescued the lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. Additionally, the intracellular cholesterol accumulation in PS1-KO and PS2-KO MEFs was prevented by NPC1 overexpression. Collectively, these data indicate that PS/γ-secretase dysfunction results in an impairment of protein N-glycosylation, which eventually causes NPC1 decrease and intracellular cholesterol accumulation. 3'RNASeq of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with PS1- or PS2-deficiency compared with controls.

These rare diseases share a common mutational feature that is the expansion of CAG repeat sequence in disease causing genes. These mutations lead to neuronal accumulation of expanded polyglutamine proteins and selective patterns of neurodegeneration. SCA7 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in ATAXIN-7 (ATXN7), a subcomponent of co-activatory transcriptional complex SAGA and primarily affects the cerebellum, retina and brainstem. Currently, only treatments alleviating symptoms are available to patients. Allele-selective lowering of mutant polyQ proteins promises to have high therapeutic outcomes and safety profiles.

Initially thought to be caused by age-associated accumulation of plaques, in recent years, research has increasingly associated AD with lysosomal storage and metabolic disorders, and the explanation of its pathogenesis has shifted from amyloid and tau accumulation to oxidative stress and impaired lipid and glucose metabolism aggravated by hypoxic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms linking those cellular processes and conditions to disease progression have yet to be defined. Here, we applied a disease similarity approach to identify unknown molecular targets of AD by using transcriptomic data from congenital diseases known to increase AD risk, namely Down Syndrome, Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC), and Mucopolysaccharidoses I. We uncovered common pathways, hub genes, and miRNAs across in vitro and in vivo models of these diseases as potential molecular targets for neuroprotection and amelioration of AD pathology, many of which have never been associated with AD. We then investigated common molecular alterations in brain samples from an NPC disease mouse model by juxtaposing them with brain samples of both human and mouse models of AD. Detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses revealed the NPCmut mouse as a novel, short-lived in vivo model of AD characterized by accelerated brain aging, concluding that the NPCmut mouse model can serve as a potential short-lived in vivo model for AD research and for understanding molecular factors affecting brain aging. This research represents the first comprehensive approach to congenital disease association with neurodegeneration and a new perspective on AD research while highlighting shortcomings and lack of correlation in diverse in vitro models. Considering the lack of an AD mouse model that recapitulates the physiological hallmarks of brain aging, the characterization of a short-lived NPC mouse model will further accelerate the research in these fields and offer a unique model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD from a perspective of accelerated brain aging.",12

Here we investigate whether deficiency in Senataxin, an RNA-DNA helicase associated with cerebellar ataxia and ALS, induces destabilization of intrinsically disordered proteins as we previously found with Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and tissue. We find that Senataxin loss does generate protein aggregates but, unlike in A-T, these are associated with the nucleolus and are independent of oxidative stress and PARP activity. Non-coding RNA expression from the intergenic spacer region of ribosomal DNA is induced in the absence of Senataxin and drives the association and aggregation of many proteins known to be prone to aggregation in neurodegenerative disease. Both non-coding RNAs and protein aggregates are eliminated by overexpression of RNaseH1, implicating RNA-DNA hybrids as the key driver of these outcomes. We find that hybrids are high in the absence of Senataxin at intergenic sites, not at annotated protein-coding genes; these include sites of Senataxin binding in the genome, ribosomal DNA, and peri-centromeric regions. These findings suggest that destabilization of the proteome is driven by Senataxin loss and that RNA-DNA hybrids and non-coding RNAs play a critical role in this process.",17

As such, S2L were developed as imaging probes (ISO1) or as cancer therapeutics, alone (SV119 [C6], SW43 [C10]) and as delivery vehicles for cytotoxic drug cargoes following chemical conjugation (C6-Erastin, C10-SMAC). However, the exact mechanism of S2L-induced cytotoxicity remains to be fully elucidated. A series of high-affinity S2L were evaluated regarding their cytotoxicity profiles across pancreatic, ovarian, and synovial cancer cell lines. While C6 and C10 displayed distinct cytotoxicities (extended aliphatic side chains), C0 (no aliphatic side chain) and ISO1 (structurally unrelated) were essentially non-toxic, enabling us to investigate the unique mechanism of S2L cytotoxicity. Confocal microscopy and lipidomics analysis in cellular and mouse models revealed that C10 induced an increase in intralysosomal free cholesterol, a corresponding increase in cholesterol esters, suggestive of unaltered intracellular cholesterol trafficking and processing, and cytotoxicity due to cholesterol excess, a phenomenon that contrasts the effects of inhibiting NPC1 function. RNA-sequencing revealed that gene clusters involved in cholesterol homeostasis and ER stress response were activated exclusively by cytotoxic S2L. ER stress markers were confirmed on qPCR, and ER stress modulators inhibited or enhanced cytotoxicity of C10 confirming the involvement of ER stress response in the cytotoxicity of S2L. Moreover, C10 increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) which were also confirmed with qPCR and at the protein level and were found to be a pro-survival mechanism activated by ER stress response. Moreover, inhibiting the processes downstream this adaptive response with simvastatin resulted in synergistic treatment outcomes when combined with C10 in vitro and in vivo. Of note, the conjugates retained the S2L-mediated cholesterol phenotype of their parental ligands, which suggests that disrupting cholesterol homeostasis might contribute to the overall cytotoxicity of the drug conjugates. Furthermore, these phenomena were seen exclusively with cytotoxic S2L. Based on these findings, we conclude that S2L-mediated cell death is due to free cholesterol accumulation that leads to ER stress. Consequently, the cytotoxic profiles of S2L drug conjugates are proposed to be enhanced via concurrent ER stress inducers or simvastatin, strategies that could be instrumental on the path toward tumor eradication.",12

Dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway occurs in approximately 50% of TNBC patients. We performed a genome-wide negative selection CRISPR/Cas9 screen with PI3K and AKT inhibitors to identify targetable synthetic lethalities in TNBC. We found that cholesterol homeostasis is a collateral vulnerability with AKT inhibition. Disruption of cholesterol homeostasis with pitavastatin synergized with AKT inhibition to induce TNBC cytotoxicity in vitro, in mouse TNBC xenografts and in patient-derived organoids of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer. Neither ER-positive breast cancer cell lines nor ER-positive organoids were sensitive to combined AKT inhibitor and pitavastatin. Mechanistically, TNBCs show dysregulated SREBP-2 activation in response to single agent or combination AKT inhibitor and pitavastatin, and this was rescued by inhibition of the cholesterol trafficking protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). NPC1 loss promoted lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, decreased endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol levels and promoted SREBP-2 activation. Taken together, these data identify a TNBC-specific vulnerability to the combination of AKT inhibitors and pitavastatin mediated by dysregulated cholesterol trafficking. This work motivates combining AKT inhibitors with pitavastatin as a therapeutic modality in TNBC. ",48

Stomatin transgenic mice fed with high-fat diets exhibit obesity, insulin resistance and hepatic impairments; however, such phenotypes are not seen if feeding the transgenic animals with regular diets. Inhibitions of stomatin by gene knockdown or OB-1 pharmacological treatments inhibit adipogenic differentiation and LD growth through downregulation of PPARγ pathway.

In both trials, there were immune responders and non-responders to the vaccine. Here we used PBMC pre-vaccination and 2 weeks after the first vaccine of responders and non-responders selected from both trials to identify early biomarkers of immune response involved in longterm memory generation and prevention of adenoma recurrence. We performed flow cytometry, phosflow, and differential gene expression analyses on PBMCs collected from MUC1 vaccine responders and non-responders pre-vaccination and two weeks after the first of three vaccine doses. MUC1 vaccine responders had higher frequencies of CD4 cells pre-vaccination, increased expression of CD40L on CD8 and CD4 T-cells, and a greater increase in ICOS expression on CD8 T-cells. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that iCOSL, PI3K AKT MTOR, and B-cell signaling pathways are activated early in response to the MUC1 vaccine. We identified six specific transcripts involved in elevated antigen presentation, B-cell activation, and NF-kB1 activation that were directly linked to finding antibody response at week 12. Finally, a model using these transcripts was able to predict non-responders with accuracy. These findings suggest that individuals who can be predicted to respond to the MUC1 vaccine, and potentially other vaccines, have greater readiness in all immune compartments to present and respond to antigens.

In one cohort where approximately half of TBT-exposed male mice developed tumors at 10 months (Katz, 2020), transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and epigenomic (ChIP-seq) profiling was performed on blood and liver tissue from mice that developed tumors (i.e. “high-risk”) and equivalently exposed mice did not (i.e “low-risk”).  Blood transcriptomic signatures separated TBT-exposed from vehicle controls but did not discriminate between animals that developed tumors vs those that did not.  However, uninvolved liver tissue of mice with tumors exhibited transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures distinct from liver tissue of mice without tumors and had many features in common with tumors.  These high-risk transcriptomic and epigenomic features were also found in 10/26 TBT-exposed mice at 5 months, indicating that this risk signature preceded tumor development.  Thus, while early life exposure to TBT exhibits variable penetrance for tumor development, indicating TBT-exposure is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, increased risk for tumor development is linked to epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming of the liver induced by this EDC.",15

We investigated CD25 regulation and function using a series of mice with deletions spanning STAT5-binding elements. Deleting the upstream super-enhancer region mainly affected constitutive CD25 expression on DN2/DN3 thymocytes and Tregs, with these mice developing autoimmune alopecia, whereas deleting an intronic region decreased IL-2-induced CD25 on peripheral T and NK cells. Thus, distinct super-enhancer elements preferentially control constitutive versus inducible expression in a cell type-specific manner. The mediator-1 coactivator colocalized with specific STAT5-binding sites. Moreover, both upstream and intronic regions had extensive chromatin interactions, and deletion of either region altered the super-enhancer structure in mature T cells. These results demonstrate differential functions for distinct super-enhancer elements, thereby indicating previously unknown ways to manipulate CD25 expression in a cell type-specific fashion.",25

"GSE280460","Homo sapiens","Other","Spatially-resolved molecular sex differences at single cell resolution in the adult human hypothalamus [Xenium]","The hypothalamus (HYP) underlies basal endocrine, physiological, and behavioral drives which inherently differ across species and sexes—ranging from growth and puberty to appetite and metabolism to social behavior. Especially in the rodent brain, these sex-differentiated functions correspond to differences in the volume, cell types, and gene expression of distinct HYP subareas. Recent studies have elucidated the transcriptional profile of single cells in the rodent ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and arcuate (ARC), which influence appetitive/social behaviors and growth/metabolism, respectively. However, there is a paucity of studies examining the molecular architecture of the adult human HYP, and transcriptional sex differences in the human VMH and ARC have not been characterized in single-cell or spatial contexts. Using 10x Genomics Visium and Xenium platforms, we generated a multimodal, spatially-resolved molecular atlas of human postmortem VMH and ARC from male and female adult donors. Sex-differential gene expression analysis within these regions revealed correlated autosomal expression differences, with stronger overall sex effects in the ARC. We then leveraged the single-cell-resolution of Xenium to localize sex-differential expression to cell types, finding most occur in ESR1- and KISS1-expressing neurons of the ARC. Finally, we investigated VMH and ARC gene expression in relation to genes associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, identifying a striking enrichment of genes upregulated in the male VMH for known and candidate risk genes for autism spectrum disorders. This work provides a multisample view of the human VMH and ARC in young/middle adulthood across both sexes, including data at both transcriptome-wide and single-cell resolutions, the first single-cell transcriptional atlas of molecular sex differences in the adult human VMH and ARC, and highlights potential sex-differentiated roles for VMH and ARC in neurobehavioral disorders.",13
"GSE277304","Mus musculus","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Macrophage-Specific Lactate Dehydrogenase Expression Modulates Inflammatory Function In Vitro","Background:  In acute kidney injury, macrophages play a major role in regulating inflammation. Classically activated macrophages (M1) undergo drastic metabolic reprogramming during their differentiation and upregulate the aerobic glycolysis pathway to fulfill their pro-inflammatory functions. NAD+ regeneration is crucial for the maintenance of glycolysis and the most direct pathway by which this occurs is via the fermentation of pyruvate to lactate, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Our previous study determined that LDHA is predominantly expressed in the proximal segments of the nephron in the mouse kidney and increases with hypoxia. This study investigates the potential of LDHA as a therapeutic target for inflammation by exploring its role in macrophage function in vitro. Methods:  Bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from myeloid-specific LDHA knockout mice derived from crossbreeding LysM-Cre transgenic mice and LDHA floxed mice. RNA sequencing and LC-MS/MS metabolomics analyses were used in this study to determine the effect of LDHA deletion on BMDM following stimulation with IFN-γ. Results: LDHA deletion in IFN-γ BMDMs resulted in a significant alteration of the macrophage activation and functional pathways, and change in glycolytic, cytokine, and chemokine gene expression. Metabolite concentrations associated with pro-inflammatory macrophage profiles were diminished while anti-inflammatory-associated ones were increased in LDHA KO BMDMs. Glutamate and amino sugars metabolic pathways were significantly affected by the LDHA deletion. A combined muti-omics analysis highlighted changes in Rap1 signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and MAPK signaling metabolism pathways. Conclusions:  Deletion of LDHA in macrophages results in a notable reduction in the pro-inflammatory profile and concurrent upregulation of anti-inflammatory pathways. These findings suggest that LDHA could serve as a promising therapeutic target for inflammation, a key contributor to the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury.",18

However, the sudden multiplication of all chromosome content may present physiological challenges to the cells in which it occurs. Experimental studies have associated increases in ploidy with reduced cell survival and proliferation (Andalis et al., 2004; Fujiwara et al., 2005). To understand the physiological challenges that suddenly-increased chromosome content imposes on cells, we used S. cerevisiae cells to ask how much chromosomal DNA cells may contain, and what determines this limit. We generated polyploid cells using two distinct methods causing cells to undergo endoreplication and identified the maximum ploidy of these cells, 32-64C. We found that physical determinants that alleviate or exacerbate cell surface stress increase and decrease the limit to ploidy, respectively. We also used these cells to investigate gene expression changes associated with increased ploidy, and identified the repression of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. We propose that ploidy is inherently limited by the impacts of growth in size, which accompany whole genome duplication, to cell surface integrity.",72

To test deconvolution performance, we evaluated RMSE in predicting principal component one of DNAm variation in 204 external placental samples. We analyzed DNAm profiles (n=368,435 sites) from 12 cell types: cytotrophoblasts (n=18), endothelial cells (n=19), Hofbauer cells (n=26), stromal cells (n=21), syncytiotrophoblasts (n=4), six lymphocyte types (n=36), and nucleated red blood cells (n=11). Median cell composition was consistent with placental biology: 60.4% syncytiotrophoblast, 17.1% stromal, 8.8% endothelial, 4.5% cytotrophoblast, 3.9% Hofbauer, 1.7% nucleated red blood cells, and 1.2% neutrophils. Our expanded reference outperformed an existing reference in predicting DNAm variation (15.4% variance explained, IQR=21.61) with cell composition estimates (RMSE:10.51 vs. 11.43, p-value<0.001).

A major public health and clinical problem are leprosy reactions, which are inflammatory episodes that often contribute to nerve damage and disability. Type I reversal reactions (T1R) can occur after microbiological cure of leprosy and affect up to 50% of leprosy patients. Early intervention to prevent T1R and, hence, nerve damage, is a major focus of current leprosy control efforts. In this study, we compared transcript (i.e. isoform) expression and usage profiles from leprosy patients free of T1R at enrollment (who eventually developed T1R) against T1R-free leprosy patients. Our results showed that, at baseline, cells from T1R-destined and T1R-free subjects had no main difference in their transcripts expression and usage. However, the cells of T1R patients displayed a transcriptomic immune response to M. leprae antigens that was significantly different from the one of cells from leprosy patients who remained T1R-free. Transcripts with significantly higher upregulation in the T1R-destined group, compared to the cells from T1R-free patients, were enriched for pathways and GO terms involved in response to intracellular pathogens, apoptosis regulation and inflammatory processes. Similarly, transcript usage analysis pinpointed different transcript proportions in response to the in-vitro challenge of cells from T1R-destined patients. Hence, transcript usage in concert with transcript expression suggested a dysregulated inflammatory response including increased apoptosis regulation in the peripheral blood cells of T1R-destined patients before the onset of T1R symptoms. Combined, these results provided detailed insight into the pathogenesis of T1R.",64

Newly metastasising cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours.  There is interest in exploiting this vulnerability to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis.  Here, we show that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, including with aspirin, enhances immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelet TXA2 triggers an immunosuppressive pathway within T cells dependent upon the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor (TCR)-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases.  Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or through platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner dependent upon T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo.  These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway limiting T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing a mechanistic basis for the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.",15

In type 2 diabetes (T2D), islet GlyR activity is impaired by unknown mechanisms. We sought to investigate if the GlyR dysfunction in T2D is replicated by hyperglycemia per se, and to further characterize its action in β cells and the islets.   Methods: GlyR-mediated currents were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp in human β cells from donors with or without T2D, or after high glucose culture. We also correlated glycine-induced current amplitude with transcript expression levels through patch-seq. The expression of the GlyR α1, α3, and β subunit mRNA splice variants was compared between islets from donors with and without T2D, and after high glucose culture. Insulin secretion from human islets was measured in the presence or absence of the GlyR antagonist strychnine.  Results: Gene expression of GlyRs was decreased in islets from T2D donors along with smaller GlyR-mediated currents in the β cells. Glycine-induced currents are also reduced in islets from donors without diabetes after 48 hours of culture in high glucose, along with reducedα1 subunit expression and increased  α3 subunit expression. Glycine-evoked currents are highly heterogeneous between different β cells within and between donors; inversely correlated with donor HbA1c; and significantly correlated to the expression of 99 different transcripts.

By contrast, in tumors originating from these cells, AR chromatin occupancy is extensively reprogrammed to drive hyper-proliferative, metastatic, or therapy-resistant phenotypes, the molecular mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. Here we show that the tumor-specific enhancer circuitry of AR is critically reliant on the activity of Nuclear Receptor Binding SET Domain Protein 2 (NSD2), a histone 3 lysine 36 di-methyltransferase. NSD2 is ectopically expressed in prostate cancer cells and catalytic inhibition of NSD2 impairs AR trans-activation potential through partial off-loading from over 40,000 genomic sites or greater than 65% of its cistrome. The NSD2-dependent AR sites distinctly harbor a chimeric AR-half motif juxtaposed to a FOXA1 element. Similar chimeric motifs of AR are absent at the NSD2-independent AR enhancers and contain the canonical palindromic motifs instead. Meta-analyses of AR cistromes from patient tumors uncovered chimeric AR motifs to exclusively participate in tumor-specific enhancer circuitries, with a minimal role in physiological activity of AR. Accordingly, NSD2 inactivation attenuated hallmark cancer phenotypes that were fully reinstated upon exogenous NSD2 re-expression. Inactivation of NSD2 also engendered increased dependency on its paralog NSD1, which independently maintained AR and MYC hyper-transcriptional programs in cancer cells. Therapeutically exploiting these insights, we developed a dual NSD1/2 PROTAC degrader, called LLC0150, which was preferentially cytotoxic in AR-dependent prostate cancer and synergized with enzalutamide. In a pan-cancer screen, comprising over 120 cell lines from 22 distinct lineages, NSD1/2 co-degradation triggered apoptotic cell death in AR-addicted prostate cancer as well as NSD2-altered hematologic malignancies. Altogether, we identify NSD2 as a novel subunit of the AR neo-enhanceosome that wires prostate cancer gene expression programs, positioning NSD1/2 paralog co-targeting as a novel and potent therapeutic strategy.",12

The objective to identify novel epigenetically regulated genes and pathways associated with ‘train-low sleep-low’ paradigms. The sleep-low conditions included 9 males that cycled to deplete muscle glycogen while reaching a set energy expenditure. Post-exercise, low-CHO meals (protein-matched) completely replaced (using high-fat) or only partially replaced (low-fat) the energy expended. The following morning resting baseline biopsies were taken and the participants then undertook 75 minutes of cycling exercise, with skeletal muscle biopsies collected 30 minutes and 3.5 hours post exercise. Discovery of genome-wide DNA methylation was undertaken using Illumina EPIC arrays and targeted gene expression analysis was conducted by RT-qPCR. At baseline participants under energy balance (high fat) demonstrated a predominantly hypermethylated (60%) profile across the genome compared to energy deficit-low fat conditions. However, post exercise performed in energy balance (with high fat) elicited a more prominent hypomethylation signature 30 minutes post-exercise in gene regulatory regions important for transcription (CpG islands within promoter regions) compared with exercise in energy deficit (with low fat) conditions. Such hypomethylation was enriched within pathways related to: IL6-JAK-STAT signalling, metabolic processes, p53 / cell cycle and oxidative / fatty acid metabolism. Hypomethylation within the promoter regions of genes: HDAC2, MECR, IGF2 and c13orf16 were associated with significant increases in gene expression in the post-exercise period in energy balance compared with energy deficit. Furthermore, histone deacetylase, HDAC11 was oppositely regulated at the gene expression level compared with HDAC2, where HDAC11 was hypomethylated yet increased in energy deficit compared with energy balance conditions. Overall, we identify some novel epigenetically regulated genes associated with train-low sleep-low paradigms.",23

However, the function of heterochromatin components is not fully understood. Here, we characterize the localization, the biogenesis and the function of an atypical heterochromatin, which is simultaneously enriched in the typical heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 as well as in H3K36me3, histone mark usually associated with gene expression. This dual heterochromatin forms on 3,015 regions in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells and relies on the histone methyltransferases SET Domain Bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) and Nuclear Set Domain containing proteins (NSD) to generate H3K9me3 and H3K36me3, respectively. Upon SETDB1 removal, dual domains loose both trimethyl marks, gain epigenomic signatures of active enhancers, and come into long range contact with upregulated genes, suggesting that it is a major pathway by which gene expression is controlled by heterochromatin. In differentiated tissues, a large subset of these dual domains is destabilized and become enriched in active enhancer marks, providing a mechanistic insight into the involvement of heterochromatin in development and the maintenance of cell identity.",88

Here, we explore the role of histone H3 methylated at lysine-36 (H3K36) and the associated methyltransferases—Set2, NSD, and Ash1—in these two chromosome-specific systems. We show that the loss of Set2 impairs the MSL complex–mediated dosage compensation; however, the effect is not recapitulated by H3K36 replacement and indicates an alternative target of Set2. Unexpectedly, balanced transcriptional output from the fourth chromosome requires intact H3K36 and depends on the additive functions of NSD and Ash1. We conclude that H3K36 methylation and the associated methyltransferases are important factors to balance transcriptional output of the male X chromosome and the fourth chromosome.

AH is a complex disease encompassing the dysregulation of many cells and cell subpopulations. This study used a hepatic spatial transcriptomic and proteomic approach (10X Genomics Visium) to identify hepatic cell populations and their associated transcriptomic and proteomic alterations in human AH. Methods: Formalin fixed parraffin embedded liver tissue from AH patients (n=2) and non-ALD controls (donors) (n=2) were used for Visium spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Results: AH cell clusters and cell markers were drastically different in regard to tissue pattern and number of cell type as compared to non-ALD controls. Cholangiocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, and stellate cells were more profuse in AH relative to non-ALD controls. Transcriptionally, proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive (PCNA+) hepatocytes in AH more closely resembled cholangiocytes suggesting they were non-functional hepatocytes derived from cholangiocytes. Further, mitochondria protein coding genes were reduced in AH vs non-ALD control hepatocytes, suggesting reduced functionality and loss of regenerative mechanisms. Macrophages in AH exhibited elevated gene expression involved in exosomes as compared to non-ALD controls. The most upregulated macrophage genes observed in AH were those involved in exosome trafficking and cellular migration. Gene and protein signatures of disease associated hepatocytes (ANXA2+/CXCL1+/CEACAM8+) were elevated in AH and could visually identify a pre-malignant lesion. Conclusions: This study identified global cell type alterations in AH and distinct transcriptomic changes between AH and non-ALD controls. These findings characterizes cellular plasticity and profuse transcriptomic and proteomic changes that are apparent in AH and contributes to the identification of novel therapeutics.",8

Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the critical lack of therapies promoting remyelination and slowing progression in MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, produces a shift in microglia and CNS macrophage transcriptional programs from pro-inflammatory to regenerative phenotypes, both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 stimulated scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that prevent the activation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes while promoting neuroaxonal health and oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment with bryo-1 augmented remyelination following a focal demyelinating injury in vivo.

A T cell-specific deletion of Hdac1 (HDAC1cKO) protects mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it remains elusive whether inhibition of HDAC1 enzymatic activity and thus mimicking HDAC1 inhibitor treatment is sufficient to block EAE induction. In order to address this question, we generated a novel mouse strain that expresses catalytically inactive HDAC1 (HDAC1Off) from the Rosa26 locus in HDAC1cKO CD4+ T cells to mimic selective inhibition of HDAC1 enzymatic activity in vivo. Mice expressing wildtype HDAC1 in HDAC1cKO CD4+ T cells (HDAC1On) were generated as corresponding controls. In contrast to HDAC1On mice, HDAC1Off mice did not develop EAE, and this correlated with diminished leukocyte CNS infiltration. HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells in the CNS displayed a severe reduction of IFNγ, IL-17A and TNFα proinflammatory cytokine expression. In vivo activated HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells downregulated gene sets associated with T cell activation, inflammatory response and cell migration, indicating impaired effector functions of HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells. Thus, our study demonstrates that the inhibition of the catalytic activity of HDAC1 is sufficient to achieve a clinical benefit in EAE disease development. This raises the exciting translational perspective that targeting HDAC1 enzymatic activity is a promising therapeutic strategy in treating human T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.",6

In this context, mitochondria play an important role and take up Ca2+ to support elevated bioenergetic demands. The protein machinery that regulates mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+) uptake; the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, could be thus implicated in T-cell immunity. However, the exact role of MCU in T-cells is not understood. Here, we show that upon activation of naïve T-cells, the MCU complex undergoes a compositional rearrangement that causes elevated mCa2+ uptake and increased bioenergetic output. Transcriptome and proteome analyses reveal molecular determinants involved in mitochondrial functional reprograming and identify signaling pathways controlled by MCU. MCUa knockdown diminishes mCa2+ uptake, mitochondrial respiration and ATP production as well as T-cell invasion and cytokine secretion. In vivo, downregulation of MCUa in rat CD4+ T-cells suppresses autoimmune responses in a multiple sclerosis model of inflammatory experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In summary, Ca2+ uptake through MCU is essential for proper T-cell function and is involved in autoimmunity. T-cell specific MCU inhibition is a potential tool for treating autoimmune disorders.",8

In multiple independent datasets, MCL1-M high MMs exhibited poorer prognosis compared to MCL1-M low MMs. Re-analysis of the phase III HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 showed that only MCL1-M MMs, but not MCL1-M low MMs, benefited from bortezomib-based treatment. To translate the MCL1-M clustering scheme into a platform for individual diagnosis, we refined the classifier genes and developed a support vector machine-based algorithm. Individual MMs with transcriptome assessed at the RNA-seq or U133 plus 2.0 array platform can be robustly assigned as the MCL1-M high or low subtype with high confidence. Analyses of the MM samples in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial and APEX trial reinforce that only MCL1-M high MMs benefit from bortezomib-based treatment with a hazard ratio of 0.58 (P = 0.010) and 0.47 (P = 0.009), respectively. Thus, MCL1-M based subtyping assigns MMs into prognostic and predictive molecular subtypes driven by subtype-specific pathogenic pathways.",93

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common form of IRD, is characterized by gradual dysfunction and degeneration of rod photoreceptors, followed by the loss of cone photoreceptors. Recently, we identified reserpine as a lead molecule for maintaining rod survival in mouse and human retinal organoids as well as in the rd16 mouse, which phenocopy Leber congenital amaurosis caused by mutations in the cilia-centrosomal gene CEP290 (Chen et al. eLife 2023;12:e83205. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83205). Here, we show the therapeutic potential of reserpine in a rhodopsin P23H rat model of autosomal dominant RP. At postnatal day (P) 68, when males and females are analyzed together, the reserpine-treated rats exhibit higher rod-derived scotopic b-wave amplitudes compared to the controls with little or no change in scotopic a-wave or cone-derived photopic b-wave. Interestingly, the reserpine-treated female rats display enhanced scotopic a- and b-waves and photopic b-wave responses at P68, along with a better contrast threshold and increased outer nuclear layer thickness. The female rats demonstrate better preservation of both rod and cone photoreceptors following reserpine treatment. Retinal transcriptome analysis reveals sex-specific responses to reserpine, with significant upregulation of phototransduction genes and proteostasis-related pathways, and notably, genes associated with stress response. This study builds upon our previously reported results reaffirming the potential of reserpine for gene-agnostic treatment of IRDs and emphasizes the importance of biological sex in retinal disease research and therapy development.",19

An inability to degrade HS leads to progressive neurodegeneration and death in the second or third decades of life. Knowledge of MPS III pathogenesis is incomplete, and no effective therapies exist. We generated the hypomorphic mutations sgshS387Lfs, nagluA603Efs and hgsnatG577Sfsin the endogenous zebrafish genes orthologous to human SGSH, NAGLU, and HGSNAT that are loci for mutations causing MPS III subtypes MPS IIIA, B and C respectively. Our models display the primary MPS III disease signature of significant brain accumulation of HS, while behavioural analyses support hyperactivity phenotypes. Brain transcriptome analysis revealed changes related to lysosomal, glycosaminoglycan, immune system and iron homeostasis biology in all three models but also distinct differences in brain transcriptome state between models. The transcriptome analysis also indicated marked disturbance of the oligodendrocyte cell state in the brains of MPS IIIA, B and C zebrafish, supporting that effects on this cell type are an early and consistent characteristic of MPS III. Overall, our zebrafish models recapture key characteristics of the human disease and phenotypes seen in mouse models.

Previously, we have shown that SOCE is impaired in the diabetic pancreatic β cell; however, the consequences of reduced β cell SOCE have not been well studied. To test this, we generated mice with pancreatic β cell specific deletion of STIM1 (STIM1Δβ). Our results revealed a striking sexual dimorphism in metabolic phenotypes when STIM1Δβ mice were challenged with high fat diet for 8 weeks. Male STIM1Δβ mice showed no differences in total weight, lean or fat mass, or glucose tolerance compared to WT littermate controls. In contrast, female STIM1Δβ mice displayed significantly increased total body weight, fat mass, and reduced glucose tolerance, in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and β cell mass compared to WT littermate controls, while insulin sensitivity, food intake, and energy expenditure were unchanged.    To investigate mechanisms underlying these findings, RNA sequencing was performed in isolated islets and revealed altered 17-beta estradiol (E2) signaling, lipid metabolism, epithelial cell differentiation and decreased noncanonical estradiol receptor GPER. Consistent with this, alpha cell mass was increased in female STIM1Δβ, while proteomics and immunoblot analysis of STIM1 knockout (STIM1KO) INS-1 beta cells revealed reduce insulin expression and increased glucagon expression, suggesting STIM1 may be required for the maintenance of β cell identity. To this end, we show that a reduction of a noncanonical estradiol receptor GPER in STIM1 deficient islets contributes to the marked sexual dimorphism observed during beta cell dysfunction in female STIM1Δβ mice. This present study delineates a sexually dimorphic regulation of STIM1 in the maintenance of pancreatic beta cell identity through GPER and may expand the field of therapeutic approaches to diabetes. Our findings demonstrate the importance of STIM1 and GPER expression stability in the anti-diabetogenic response from estradiol.",9

High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), that is expressed in the nucleus but released extracellularly upon inflammation has gained attention as an accelerator for skin inflammation. However, in vivo role of HMGB1 in ACD and other skin disorders remains to be elusive. In this study, we generated conditional knockout mice in which HMGB1 is deleted in keratinocytes and examined its role in skin inflammation models including 2,4-dinitrofluorobenezene (DNFB)-induced ACD. Unexpectedly, deletion of HMGB1 in keratinocytes exacerbated skin inflammation, accompanied by increased ear thickening. Elevated mRNA expression of interleukin-24 (IL-24), a known cytokine which promotes the pathogenesis of ACD, was also observed in the skin lesion of the mice. In accordance with above observations, both constitutive and IL-4-induced Il24 mRNA expression in vitro was augmented in hmgb1-deficient primary mouse keratinocytes and keratinocyte cell line PAM212 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed increased binding of tri-methyl histone H3 (lys4) (H3K4me3), a well-known histone mark for transcription active genes, to the promoter region of the Il24 gene in the hmgb1-deficient cells. ChIP-sequencing data also showed broad changes of H3K4me3 mark in the cells. Thus, HMGB1 in the nucleus dictates histone modifications.

Donor T cells persist specifically in the lungs (and not blood) of transplant recipients and express high levels of TRM signature markers including CD69, CD103, and CD49a, while lung-infiltrating recipient T cells gradually acquire TRM phenotypes over months in vivo. Single cell transcriptome profiling of airway T cells reveals that donor T cells comprise two TRM-like subsets with varying levels of expression of TRM-associated genes while recipient T cells comprised non-TRM and similar TRM-like subpopulations, suggesting de novo TRM generation. Transplant recipients exhibiting higher frequencies of persisting donor TRM experienced fewer adverse clinical events such as primary graft dysfunction and acute cellular rejection compared to recipients with low donor TRM persistence, suggesting that monitoring TRM dynamics could be clinically informative.

Compared to efflux- TRM, efflux(+) TRM showed transcriptional and phenotypic features of quiescence including reduced turnover, decreased expression of exhaustion markers, and increased proliferative capacity and signaling to homeostatic cytokines. Moreover, efflux(+) and efflux(-) TRM subsets both maintain TRM characteristics when activated, while efflux(+) TRM produce IL-17 and efflux(-) produce higher levels of IFN-γ and IL-2.

Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist and a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, reportedly has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity.  We studied the effects of telmisartan on the adipose tissue macrophage phenotype in high fat-fed mice.  Telmisartan was administered for 5 weeks to high fat-fed C57BL/6 mice.  Insulin sensitivity, macrophage infiltration, and the gene expressions of M1 and M2 markers in epididymal fat tissues were examined.  Insulin- or a glucose-tolerance test showed that telmisartan treatment improved insulin resistance, decreasing the body weight gain, visceral fat weight and adipocyte size without affecting the amount of food intake.  Telmisartan treatment reduced the number of CD11c-positive cells and crown-like structures.  Telmisartan reduced the mRNA expressions of M1 macrophage markers, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased the expression of M2 markers, such as IL-10 and Mgl2.  The reduction of M1 macrophage markers, as well as the increased gene expression of M2 markers especially IL-10, is a possible mechanism for the improvement of insulin sensitivity by telmisartan.",8

Therefore, alternative non-thermal methods are explored to inactivate foodborne pathogens like Escherichia coli while maintaining the nutritional value. However, knowledge about the effects of these technologies on bacterial cells is limited. This study analyzed differentially expressed genes of E. coli ATCC 8739 inoculated in strawberry nectar after exposure to three treatments with two sets of parameters each, namely thermal treatment, high-pressure processing (HPP), and moderate-intensity pulsed electric field (MIPEF). The highest inactivation efficiency was achieved with HPP at 400 MPa, 1 min, reducing microbial counts by 5.0±0.3 log cfu/mL, and thermal treatment at 60°C, 200 s, achieving a reduction of 4.4±0.2 log cfu/mL, while no inactivation was observed with MIPEF at 6 kV/cm. Transcriptomic analysis showed that thermal and HPP treatments caused similar molecular stress responses in E. coli. In both cases, the most overexpressed genes encoded outer membrane proteins, which may lead to the activation of the envelope stress response. Despite no microbial inactivation was revealed after MIPEF treatment, strong transcriptomic responses were observed, particularly in genes related to membrane integrity and metabolic activity. Numerous overexpressed genes associated with ABC transporters, outer membrane proteins, and lipoproteins were identified, which could increase the strain’s virulence. This study provides insights into the stress response mechanisms induced by conventional and novel treatments. Nevertheless, further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects on bacterial populations.",21

Previously, we reported increased expression of TDE_0259 (oxtR), which exhibits similarities with the multiple-antibiotic resistance regulator (marR)-like gene in the bacteriocin ABC transporter gene-deficient mutant, which altered susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Therefore, we investigated the function of oxtR in T. denticola using an oxtR-deficient mutant. We observed increased OxtR expression upon oxygen exposure. The growth rate of the bacterium was unaffected by the inactivation of oxtR. We observed a relative increase in the expression of genes associated with iron-sulfur cluster-binding proteins, flavodoxin, oligopeptide/dipeptide ABC transporters, heat shock proteins, DNA helicase, iron compounds, ABC transporters, and lipoproteins. The oxtR mutant exhibited an increased minimum inhibitory concentration against ofloxacin. In addition, the mutant showed a slightly faster growth rate than that of the wild type under oxygen stress. Our findings also suggested that OxtR may regulate the operon by binding to a potential promoter region. The oxygen-sensing regulator oxtR plays a role in regulating the expression of a potential ferredoxin, which may contribute to the response to oxygen-induced stress in T. denticola.",4

People living with HIV frequently have EBV reactivation and develop EBV-associated B-cell malignancies. In this study, we aimed to uncover the involvement of HIV-1 and EBV co-existence in the development of B-cell malignancies. We studied two viral transcriptional activators (HIV-1 Tat and EBV Zta) and their possible interaction since they both have cell-penetration domains and can be found simultaneously in the blood or cells of people with HIV. We found that Tat and Zta directly bound each other in human B cells, T cells, and blood serum. Using RNA-sequencing, we found that combined Tat and Zta action in B cells differed from a simple combination of two proteins. A subset of genes, activated by Tat or Zta alone, that trigger an immune response and antigen presentation in B cells, remained unchanged when two proteins were combined. B cells, treated or transfected with Tat and Zta, exhibited a substantial decrease in HLA-ABC (MHC class I) expression, a critical component of the antigen processing and presentation pathway. HLA-ABC downregulation induced by Tat and Zta interaction conferred protection against cytotoxic T cell recognition of EBV-infected B cells. Tat and Zta interaction was also observed in serum from an HIV-positive individual. To conclude, we demonstrated for the first time the direct interaction between HIV-1 Tat and EBV Zta; this interaction can bring about immune evasion of EBV-infected or transformed B cells.",56

Using comprehensive gene expression and T cell receptor profiling, we show that both in vitro expansion protocols generated Treg products that preserved hallmark Treg properties,  ameliorated GvHD symptoms, retained their phenotypic plasticity and rapidly acquired organ-specific gene expression profiles after BMT, comparable to their tissue-resident counterparts. When co-transplanted with GvHD-inducing T cells, Treg enabled hallmark suppressive and cytotoxic features, most evidently in the colon. Dominant Treg T cell receptor clonotypes were evenly distributed between organs and across recipients, suggesting a major role of ubiquitous alloantigen-specific Treg in controlling GvHD. Effective protection inversely correlated with the relative abundance of organ-specific Treg, that were transcriptionally distinct, less “activated” and preferentially accumulated in the colon of recipients receiving polyclonally expanded Treg.

"GSE221721","Botrytis cinerea","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Transcriptomic analysis of resistant and wild-type Botrytis ci-nerea isolates revealed fludioxonil-resistant mechanisms","Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) is one of the most destructive pathogens of cherry tomatoes, causing fruit decay and economic loss. Fludioxonil is an effective fungicide widely used for crop protec-tion and is essential for controlling tomato gray mold. The emergence of fungicide-resistant strains has made the control of Botrytis cinerea more difficult. While the genome of Botrytis cinerea is available, there are few reports regarding the large-scale functional annotation of the genome using expressed genes derived from transcriptomes, and the mechanism(s) underlying such flu-dioxonil resistance remain unclear. The present study prepared RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) li-braries for three Botrytis cinerea strains [two highly resistant (LR and FR) versus one highly sen-sitive (S) to fludioxonil], with and without fludioxonil treatment, to identify fludioxonil responsive genes that facilitate fungicide resistance. Functional enrichment analysis identified nine resistant related DEGs in the fludioxonil-induced LR and FR transcriptome that were simultaneously up regulated, and seven resistant related DEGs down regulated. These included adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-encoding genes, major facilitator super-family (MFS) transporter-encoding genes, and the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway homologues or related genes. The expression patterns of twelve out of the sixteen fludioxo-nil-responsive genes, obtained from the RNA-sequence data sets were validated using quantita-tive real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Based on RNA-sequence analysis it was found that fugal HHKs, like BOS1, BcHHK2, and Bchhk17, were in some way involved in the fludioxonil resistance of B. cinerea, in addition, a number of ABC and MFS transporter genes that were not reported before, such as BcATRO, BMR1, BMR3, BcNMT1, BcAMF1, BcTOP1, BcVBA2, and BcYHK8 were differen-tially expressed in the fludioxonil-resistant strains, indicating that overexpression of these efflux transporters located in the plasma membranes played a crucial role in the fludioxonil resistant mechanism of B. cinerea. These lines of evidence together allowed us to draw a general portrait of the anti-fludioxonil mechanisms for Botrytis cinerea, and the assembled and annotated transcrip-tome data provide valuable genomic resources for further study of the molecular mechanisms of B. cinerea resistance to fludioxonil.",18

While the subcellular localization and spatio-temporal control of mRNA translation are critical to nerve function, little is known about the transcriptional landscapes of DRG and SN in PIPN.  Aim: Transcriptome-wide assessment of Ptx-induced changes in gene expression and mRNA distribution in DRG or SN. Methods: Gene expression microarray analysis of the subcellular transcriptomes of DRG and SN in normal and PIPN mice with Transcriptome Analysis Console followed by analysis with 11 pathway databases. Validation of selected results in cultured cells and animal tissues.  Results: In normal mice, transcripts were differentially distributed in DRG and SN. In PIPN, both the gene expression profile and the distribution of the transcripts between DRG and SN were changed compared to normal controls. Functional analysis of gene clusters confirmed changes in pathways known to be affected by Ptx including including cytoskeleton remodeling, cell cycle regulation, immune response and neuronal transmission, as well as less studied pathways such as fatty acid metabolism, Rho GTPases in Wnt signaling, G-protein signal transduction, mRNA splicing and editing. Although the expression and function of cytoskeleton genes is known to be disturbed by Ptx, we found actins, actinins and non-muscle myosins (actomyosin contractility cluster) to be overexpressed by Ptx and accumulated specifically in the SN. For instance, in PIPN, the normalized ratio of SN/DRG mRNA levels for Myh7, Myh2, Actn2, Acta2 and Actb was 32.4, 24.5, 21.9, 3.6 and 3.3 respectively. We also identified transcripts overexpressed and accumulated in PIPN DRGs, with the highest DRG/SN mRNA ratios found for ion channels (ratios in parentheses) SN10a, Kcnd1, Atp1a3, Kcnip3, SN11a, (10.3-21.2); neurotransmitter regulators Syt1, Gabbr2 (14.4, 13.2); fatty acid regulators: Fabp4, Adipoq (22.9, 4.8), some tubulins: Tubb3, Tubb4a, Tubb4b (9.15, 5.5, 2.0) as well as GPCR regulating proteins: Rasgrp1, Gnal, Olfr1098 (16.7, 7.6, 2.0). Furthermore, the  Wikipathways integrated with the Transcriptome Analysis Console revealed that GPCRs were the most significantly altered class of genes, predominantly downregulated by Ptx compared to Naive samples in the DRG (320 downregulated, 88 upregulated) and in the SN (469 downregulated, 74 upregulated). In contrast, the comparison of control Naive samples in the DRG versus SN showed minimal changes (21 downregulated, 5 upregulated). These changes were statistically significant with a p-value < 0.001 and a fold change of -2 > FC > 2.  Conclusion: Our results show that Ptx not only affects the gene expression but also the subcellular localization of transcripts kept in DRG bodies or over-transported to distal parts of Sciatic Nerve along the longest axon of the body. Cargo trafficking including RNA shuttles among nucleus- cytoplasm-axon terminal of nerves might be one of the most critical processes impaired in PIPN. These results might be used in the future to develop a potential therapeutic strategy focusing on normalization of axon cargo trafficking and PIPN prevention.",15

However, the dynamic interaction between H. pylori and human gastric epithelium has not been fully documented. Here, by leveraging the advantage of dual RNA sequencing technology, we characterized a cytotoxin-associated genes A (CagA)-modulated bacterial adoption strategy by reinforcing the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-related genes, metQ and HP_0888 upon co-culturing with human gastric epithelial cells (GES-1), thus, to benefit intracellular H. pylori survival through facilitating the uptake of host-provided nutrients. We further detected a generally repressed impact on electron transportation-associated genes by CagA, leading to the activation of oxidative phosphorylation. Temporal profiling of host mRNA signatures revealed down-regulation of multiple splicing regulators elicited by bacterial infection. Consequently, aberrant pre-mRNA splicing of functional genes that were involved in cell cycle process in response to H. pylori infection were identified. Moreover, we verified a protective effect for gastric H. pylori colonization against chronic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis.

There is a limited understanding of the mechanistic pathways linked to post-acute pulmonary sequelae. Our main goal was to identify the molecular underpinnings associated with severe lung diffusion involvement in survivors of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. Survivors attended to a complete pulmonary evaluation 3 months after hospital discharge. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed using Illumina technology in whole-blood samples from 50 patients with moderate to severe diffusion impairment (DLCO<60%) and age- and sex-matched individuals with mild-normal lung function (DLCO≥60%). A transcriptomic signature for optimal classification was constructed using random forest. Transcriptomic data were analyzed for biological pathway enrichment, cellular deconvolution, cell/tissue-specific gene expression and candidate drugs. RNA-seq identified 1357 differentially expressed transcripts. A model composed of 14 mRNAs allowed the optimal discrimination of survivors with severe diffusion impairment (AUC=0.979). Hallmarks of lung sequelae involved cell death signaling, cytoskeleton reorganization, cell growth and differentiation and the immune response. Resting natural killer (NK) cells were the most important immune cell subtype for the prediction of severe diffusion impairment. Components of the signature correlated with neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts. A variable expression profile of the transcripts was observed in lung cell subtypes and bodily tissues.

Escherichia coli DH10β is an optimal system to study the microbial response to low-dose ionizing radiation at the transcriptional level because it is a well-characterized model bacterium and its responses to other environmental stressors, including those to higher radiation doses, have been elucidated in prior studies. In this study, RNA sequencing with downstream transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) was employed to characterize the global transcriptional response of stationary-phase E. coli subjected to Pu-239, H-3 (tritium), and Fe-55, at an approximate absorbed dose rate of 10 mGy day-1 for 1 day and 15 days. Differential expression analysis identified significant changes in gene expression of E. coli for both short- and long-term exposures. Radionuclide source exposure induced differential expression in E. coli of genes involved in biosynthesis pathways of nuclear envelope components, amino acids, and siderophores, transport systems such as ABC transporters and type II secretion proteins, and initiation of stress response and regulatory systems of temperature stress, the RpoS regulon, and oxidative stress. These findings provide a basic understanding of the relationship between low-dose exposure and biological effect of a model bacterium that is critical for applications in alternative nuclear material detection and bioremediation. IMPORTANCE Escherichia coli strain DH10β, a well-characterized model bacterium, was subjected to short-term (1-day) and long-term (15-day) exposures to three different in situ radiation sources comprised of radionuclides relevant to nuclear activities to induce a measurable and identifiable genetic response. We found E. coli had both common and unique responses to the three exposures studied, suggesting both dose rate- and radionuclide-specific effects. This study is the first to provide insights into the transcriptional response of a microorganism in short- and long-term exposure to continuous low-dose ionizing radiation with multiple in situ radionuclide sources and the first to examine microbial transcriptional response in stationary phase.

Inhalational anthrax almost invariably proceeds to fatal systemic infection, characterized by massive bacteremia. A better understanding of host-pathogen interactions is urgently needed for effective treatment of this lethal disease. However, virulence mechanisms used by B. anthracis to survive and multiply in human blood are not completely understood. Identification of genes that are differentially expressed during the growth of B. anthracis in human serum can elucidate how this pathogen successfully colonizes the bloodstream. We compared the transcriptional profile of B. anthracis growing in heat-inactivated human serum to that in LB medium. Genes involved in the biosynthesis of purines, certain amino acids and riboflavin and lipid metabolism, genes encoding ABC transporters, respiratory enzymes and several genes with hypothetical function were identified as being upregulated during growth in serum.",4

In humans, the sleep quantity and quality of individuals are governed by genetic factors and exhibit age-dependent variations. However, the molecular pathways and effector mechanisms that regulate daily sleep need in mammals remain unknown. Here, using an adult brain chimeric (ABC)-expression/knockout (KO) system for somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult mice, we report that gain-of-function of histone deacetylases HDAC4/5 significantly reduces, whereas loss-of-function of HDAC4/5 increases daily non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) amount and delta power–two key indicators of sleep need. Similarly, ABC-expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) or A-CREB, an inhibitor of transcriptional activity of CREB, decreases or increases NREMS amount and delta power, respectively. A combination of genetic and transcriptomic analysis reveals that HDAC4 functions in tandem with CREB in both transcriptional and sleep regulation. Consistent with their functions downstream of LKB1-SIK3 kinase cascade, ABC-expression of HDAC4/5CA or CREB rescues hypersomnia of Sik3E13∆/+ mice, whereas ABC-expression of SIK3/SLP-ST221E or HDAC(4+5)VP16 rescues insomnia of ABC-Lkb1KO mice. Taken together, these results identify LKB1-SIK3-HDAC4/5-CREB as the first major molecular pathway for transcriptional regulation of daily sleep need in mammals.",4

However, the core molecular pathways and effector mechanisms that regulate sleep time in mammals remain unclear. Here, we characterize a major signaling pathway for transcriptional regulation of sleep quantity in mice by adeno-associated virus-mediated somatic genetics analysis. Adult brain chimeric-knockout of LKB1 kinase, an activator of AMPK-related protein kinase SIK3/SLEEPY, markedly reduces non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) amount and delta power–a measure of sleep depth. Downstream of LKB1-SIK3 pathway, gain or loss-of-function of histone deacetylases HDAC4/5 in adult brain neurons causes bidirectional changes of NREMS amount and delta power. Phosphorylation of HDAC4/5 is regulated in relation to sleep need, and HDAC4 specifically regulates sleep amount in posterior hypothalamus. Genetic and transcriptomic studies reveal that HDAC4 cooperates with CREB in both transcriptional and sleep regulation. These findings introduce the concept of signaling pathways targeting transcription modulators to regulate daily sleep amount and demonstrate utility of somatic genetics in mouse sleep research.",120

Balb/c mice were subjected to CBDL. Immunohistochemical analyses and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction were performed on pulmonary tissues. The presence of HPS markers were detected by western blot and microarray analyses. We observed extensive proliferation of CD31-positive pulmonary vascular endothelial cells 2 weeks after CBDL, and identified 11 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated proteins that were associated with angiogenesis. MMP-9 protein was highly expressed at 3 weeks after CBDL, and less expressed in lungs of the control group. Contrary to our expectation, lung pathology in our mouse model exhibited differences from that of rat models, and the mechanisms responsible for these differences are unknown.

Here, we report the generation of NLRP3-mutant and non-mutant induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from two CINCA syndrome patients with somatic mosaicism, and describe their differentiation into macrophages (iPS-MPs). We found that mutant cells are predominantly responsible for the pathogenesis in these mosaic patients because only mutant iPS-MPs showed the disease relevant phenotype of abnormal IL-1β secretion.

Firstly, the heterozygous mice exhibit an early onset of defects in motor coordination and balance, which mirror the SCA22 patients. The degeneration and a minor loss of Purkinje cells together with the concurrent presence of neuroinflammation, as well as the previous finding on electrophysiological changes, may all contribute to the development of the SCA22 ataxia phenotype in mice carrying the Kcnd3 F227del mutant protein. Secondly, the mutant protein is retained by the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi leading to activation of the unfolded protein response and a severe trafficking defect that affects its membrane destination. Intriguingly, profound damage to Golgi is the earliest manifestation. Thirdly, transcriptomic analysis revealed that the Kcnd3 F227del mutation down-regulates a panel of genes involved in the functioning of synapse and neurogenesis which are tightly linked to the functioning of Purkinje cells. Finally, no ataxia phenotypes are detectable in knockout mice carrying a loss-of-function Kcnd3 mutation. Thus, the Kcnd3 F227del is a dominant-negative mutation.

To address this issue, we developed a PC enrichment protocol and sequenced individual nuclei from mice and patients with SCA7.

Specifically, genes marking zebrin-II PC subtypes accounted for the highest proportion of DEGs in symptomatic SCA7-266Q mice.

AR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates neuronal architecture and promotes axon regeneration; however, whether AR transcriptional functions contribute to disease pathogenesis is not fully understood. Using a differentiated PC12 cell model of SBMA, we identified dysfunction of polyQ-expanded AR in its regulation of neurite growth and maintenance. Specifically, we found that in the presence of androgens, polyQ-expanded AR inhibited neurite outgrowth, induced neurite retraction, and inhibited neurite regrowth. This dysfunction was independent of polyQ-expanded AR transcriptional activity at androgen response elements (AREs). We further showed that the formation of polyQ-expanded AR intranuclear inclusions promoted neurite retraction, which coincided with reduced expression of the neuronal differentiation marker -III-Tubulin. Finally, we revealed that cell death is not the primary outcome for cells undergoing neurite retraction; rather, these cells become senescent. Our findings reveal that mechanisms independent of AR canonical transcriptional activity underly neurite defects in a cell model of SBMA and identify senescence as a previously unappreciated pathway implicated in this pathology. These findings suggest that, in the absence of a role for AR canonical transcriptional activity in the SBMA pathologies described here, the development of SBMA therapeutics that preserve this activity may be desirable.

Using the infantile SCA7 mouse model – the SCA7266Q/5Q mouse, we examined the impact of mutant ataxin-7 on the respiratory control centers. Specifically, we examined the effect of pathological poly-Q-ataxin-7 expression on hypoglossal (XII) and phrenic motor units. Further, we identified the transcript profile of the medulla and cervical spinal cord and, investigated the XII and phrenic nerve structure as well as the neuromuscular junctions in the diaphragm and tongue. SCA-7 astrocytes showed significant intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of ataxin-7 in the XII and putative phrenic motor nuclei.

Additionally, SCA7 mice demonstrated blunted efferent output of the XII nerve and demyelination in both XII and phrenic nerves. Finally, there was an increased number of NMJ clusters with higher expression of synaptic markers in SCA7 mice compared to WT controls.

Here we investigate whether deficiency in Senataxin, an RNA-DNA helicase associated with cerebellar ataxia and ALS, induces destabilization of intrinsically disordered proteins as we previously found with Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and tissue. We find that Senataxin loss does generate protein aggregates but, unlike in A-T, these are associated with the nucleolus and are independent of oxidative stress and PARP activity. Non-coding RNA expression from the intergenic spacer region of ribosomal DNA is induced in the absence of Senataxin and drives the association and aggregation of many proteins known to be prone to aggregation in neurodegenerative disease. Both non-coding RNAs and protein aggregates are eliminated by overexpression of RNaseH1, implicating RNA-DNA hybrids as the key driver of these outcomes. We find that hybrids are high in the absence of Senataxin at intergenic sites, not at annotated protein-coding genes; these include sites of Senataxin binding in the genome, ribosomal DNA, and peri-centromeric regions. These findings suggest that destabilization of the proteome is driven by Senataxin loss and that RNA-DNA hybrids and non-coding RNAs play a critical role in this process.",17

The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. ATXN2 (or Atx2 in insects) functions in translational regulation, mRNA stability, and in the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Previous work has shown that the LSm (Like-Sm) domain of Atx2, which mediates translational activation of some target mRNAs, antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly. Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE) experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein (PABP) interacting, PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation analyses show that structured interactions between Ataxin-2 and PABP additionally help determine protein components of Ataxin-2-associated mRNP granules and contribute to Ataxin-2’s association with stress granules. Finally, in vivo experiments in Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain protects against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both promote degeneration. Taken together the data: (a) lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during different stages of translational control; (b) show how structured and non-structured interactions of Ataxin-2 contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation; and (c) demonstrate that the Ataxin-2 protein contains multiple activities that may respectively prevent or promote neurodegeneration.",2

Longitudinal behavior studies, in surviving mice up to 4 months post-acute infection, revealed persistent abnormalities in neuropsychiatric state and motor behaviors, while reflex and sensory functions recovered over time. Surviving mice showed no detectable viral RNA in the brain and minimal neuroinflammation post-acute infection.  Transcriptome analysis revealed persistent activation of immune pathways, including humoral responses, complement, and phagocytosis, and reduced levels of genes associated with ataxia telangiectasia, impaired cognitive function and memory recall, and neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.

Although PDK1 and PDP1 were expected to influence PDH in opposing directions, by several criteria they induced similar changes relative to control T cells.

Here, we identify the insulin inhibitory receptor (short: inceptor; encoded by the gene IIR) as an insulin-binding receptor that regulates insulin stores by lysosomal degradation. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived islets, we show that IIR knockout (KO) results in enhanced stem cell (SC)-β-cell differentiation and survival. Strikingly, extended in vitro culture of IIR KO SC-β-cells leads to greatly increased insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). We find that inceptor localises to clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) close to the plasma membrane (PM) and in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), as well as in secretory granules (SGs), where it acts as a sorting receptor to direct proinsulin and insulin towards lysosomal degradation.

We find that activation domains enhance a TF’s capacity to compete with nucleosomes for binding to DNA in a BAF-dependent manner, TF binding on nucleosome-free DNA is consistent with independent binding between TFs, and average TF occupancy linearly contributes to promoter activation rates. We also decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms, which can be tuned and perturbed independently. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the binding microstates observed at the enhancer and subsequent time-dependent gene expression.

Gadd45β deficiency markedly impairs SG formation and SG-mediated activation of interferon signaling in vitro. Gadd45β knockout mice are highly susceptible to RNA virus infection and their ability to produce interferon and cytokines is severely impaired. Specifically, Gadd45β interacts with the RNA-binding domain of G3BP, leading to conformational expansion of G3BP1 via dissolution of its autoinhibitory electrostatic intramolecular interaction. The acidic loop 1- and RNA-binding properties of Gadd45β markedly increase the conformational expansion and RNA-binding affinity of the G3BP1-Gadd45β complex, thereby promoting assembly of SGs.

We reported a cocktail factor approach to enhance the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived oral epithelium (OE) into SG progenitors through a three-dimensional co-culture method. Upon confirming that the embryonic SG can promote the differentiation of mESC-derived OE, we performed RNA sequence analysis to identify factors involved in the differentiation of SG progenitors. Our findings highlight several efficient pathways related to SG development, with frequent appearances of four factors: IFN-γ, TGF-β2, EGF, and IGF-1. The combined treatment using these cocktail factors increased the expression of key SG progenitor markers, including Sox9, Sox10, Krt5, and Krt14. However, absence of any one of these cocktail factors did not facilitate differentiation. Notably, aggregates treated with the cocktail factor formed SG epithelial-like structures and pre-bud-like structures on the surface.

We analysed how the lack of PDH affects Pseudomonas putida metabolism. Inactivating PDH generated a strain that can no longer use compounds whose assimilation converges into pyruvate, including sugars and several amino acids. Compounds generating acetyl-CoA supported growth. Interestingly, inactivation of PDH led to loss of the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) effect that inhibits the assimilation of non-preferred compounds when other preferred ones are also present. P. putida can degrade many aromatic compounds, most of which generate acetyl-CoA, and is a useful bacterium for biotransformation and bioremediation processes. However, the genes involved in these metabolic pathways are frequently inhibited by CCR when substrates such as glucose or mixtures of amino acids are also present. Our results show that the PDH-null strain could efficiently degrade aromatic compounds in the presence of other preferred substrates, a condition in which the wild type strain could not mineralise them.

This is mediated through nuclear mechanotransduction pathways that repress global chromatin accessibility, which is necessary for cell dancing-enhanced differentiation. We further demonstrate that cell dancing induces nuclear deformations and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) signaling, and small molecules targeting this pathway can further boost stem cell chondrogenesis. Finally, we validate that cell dancing can enhance stem cell differentiation towards multiple lineages and occurs in other commonly used hydrogel systems. These results establish cell dancing as a novel cell behavior in 3D that may be broadly applied to promote desirable cell fates and tissue outcomes.",10
"GSE269691","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by array","Stress granule-mediated sequestration of EGR1 mRNAs correlates with lomustine-induced cell death prevention","Some chemotherapy drugs influence the formation of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic RNA foci involved in stress response pathways. The exact role of SGs in promoting cell survival or apoptosis needs further clarification. The chemotherapy drug lomustine induces SG formation by activating the eIF2α kinase HRI (EIF2AK1). We performed a DNA microarray transcriptome analysis to identify genes affected by lomustine-induced stress and to explore the role of SGs. Our findings show that lomustine specifically regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic EGR1 gene. The presence of EGR1 mRNA in SGs correlates with reduced translation of EGR1 mRNA. Lomustine likely sequesters EGR1 mRNA into SGs, preventing its ribosomal translation and thereby limiting apoptosis. This supports a model where SGs selectively sequester specific mRNAs in response to stress, modulate their translation, and thus determine the fate of stressed cells.",24

Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) was a secreted glycoprotein, which involved in multiple pathophysiological process, such as metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, proliferation and metastasis. Nevertheless, the expression, function, and prognostic significance of ANGPTL4 in GC are still contradictory. Methods: Bioinformatic analysis to confirm the expression and prognosis of ANGPTLs in GC. IF staining was used to detect ANGPTL4 protein in GC samples. The molecular biological effect of ANGPTL4 was confirmed by EdU, MTT, FCS, wound healing, transwell, tube formation chorioallantoic membrane model, and nude mice model assay in GC cell lines. RNA-seq was used to confirm the potential downstream mechanism of ANGPTL4, which verified by PCR, WB, IF, co-IP and molecular docking.  Results: ANGPTL4, as an important ANGPTLs, was significantly correlated with poor diagnosis in GC patients. The proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis escaping, angiogenesis ability was enhanced by ANGPTL4 in SNU5 and MKN7, but repressed in AGS. LGALS7 could be upregulated in AGS transfected with ANGPTL4 OE, which was one of the key factors that cause ANGPTL4 to produce an anticancer phenotype.

Despite increasing DNA damage in long replicons, loss of either Tof1 or Mrc1 concurrently reduces DNA damage in regions prone to damage caused by DNA topological stress, indicating that the rapid replication promoted by the FPC fosters completing DNA replication at the cost of increased vulnerability to DNA topological stress.

A critical barrier in developing more effective treatments is the lack of understanding of specific mechanisms driving GC progression. This study investigates the role of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a non-selective cation channel known for its high Ca2+ permeability and tumor-suppressive properties in gastrointestinal cancers. Specifically, we explore the impact of SUMOylation—a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification—on TRPV1's function in GC. We demonstrate that SUMOylation of TRPV1 inhibits cell proliferation and migration in MGC-803 and AGS gastric cancer cells. By mutating amino acids near TRPV1's existing SUMO motif (slKpE), we created a bidirectional SUMO motif (EψKψE) that enhances TRPV1 SUMOylation, resulting in further suppression of GC cell proliferation and migration. In vivo studies support these findings, showing that TRPV1 SUMOylation prevents spontaneous tumorigenesis in a mouse gastric cancer model. Further investigation reveals that TRPV1 SUMOylation increases the protein's membrane expression by inhibiting its interaction with the adaptor-related protein complex 2 mu 1 subunit (AP2M1). This elevated membrane expression leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ influx, activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which in turn inhibits the proliferation and migration of GC cells. In conclusion, our study elucidates a novel mechanism wherein TRPV1 SUMOylation promotes its membrane expression and activates the TRPV1-Ca2+-AMPK signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting GC cell proliferation and migration. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular dynamics in gastric cancer and could provide a new theoretical basis for clinical treatment strategies.",8

Although hypermethylation of ZSCAN18 promoter and its consequent deficiency in a variety of malignancies has been reported recently, its functions and mechanisms in the initiation and progression of gastric cancer (GC) are not clear. This study aims to investigate the roles of ZSCAN18 in gastric carcinogenesis. Methods: Methylation of ZSCAN18 promoter in GC cell lines were analyzed via MassARRAY and treatment of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, CCK-8, colony formation, and in vivo xenograft tumor model were used to examine the expression and function of ZSCAN18. Survival analysis was performed to determine the correlation between ZSCAN18 expression and prognosis of patients with GC. Genes modulated by ZSCAN18 in NCI-N87 cells were identified through RNA next generation sequence screening and further verified by qRT-PCR in AGS and NCI-N87 cells. Results: ZSCAN18 expression was markedly reduced in GC tissues as compared with that in adjacent normal tissues due to hypermethylation in GC. Likewise, ZSCAN18 expression was also significantly reduced in a panel of GC cell lines as the result of densely methylated ZSCAN18 promoter. Forced expression of ZSCAN18 inhibited proliferation in AGS and NCI-N87 cells in vitro. Additionally, ZSCAN18 impaired growth of NCI-N87 cells in immunodeficient mice.

However, the role of TREX1 - a DNase that cleaves cytosolic nucleic acids, preventing viral- and autoimmune-related inflammatory responses - in microglia biology remains to be elucidated. Here, we leverage a model of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived engineered microglia-like cells, bulk, and single-cell transcriptomics, optical and transmission electron microscopy, and three-month-old assembloids composed of microglia and oligodendrocyte-containing organoids to interrogate TREX1 functions in human microglia. Our analyses suggest that TREX1 influences cholesterol metabolism, leading to an active microglial morphology with increased phagocytosis in the absence of TREX1. Notably, regulating cholesterol metabolism with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, FDA-approved atorvastatin, rescues these microglial phenotypes. Functionally, TREX1 in microglia is necessary for the transition from gliogenic intermediate progenitors known as pre-oligodendrocyte precursor cells (pre-OPCs) to precursors of the oligodendrocyte lineage known as OPCs, impairing oligodendrogenesis in favor of astrogliogenesis in human assembloids.

DIANA-MR micro-T, miRnada, miRDB, TarBase v.8, and ViRBase online databases were used to predict the target genes of miR-BART1-3p and GO enrichment analysis of target gene function was performed. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression levels of miR-BART1-3p and target genes in SNU719, AGS-OE and AGS gastric cancer cells.

EBVnGC significantly up-regulated the expression of AURK, BUB1B, CCNA2 and CDC20, suggesting the risk of malignant progression and recurrence. High-throughput next-generation sequencing of SNU719 and AGS to detect differences in gene expression revealed that EBVaGC cells (SNU719) up-regulated the expression of genes that inhibit malignant progression as well as potential tumor immunotherapy targets. These results are consistent with those found in the GSE51575 dataset. Fifteen miR-BART1-3p target genes, including FAM168A, TET3, HBP1, ZBTB5, ATXN7L3, KMT5C, SPARC and BMF, were predicted and screened by online tools. After the overexpression of miR-BART1-3p in AGC(EBVnGC) cells, the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability were significantly inhibited, and the signaling pathway promoting tumor progression was also limited in activation.

The model recapitulates the two main hallmarks of PD, which are α-syn aggregation and loss of dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, impairments in astrocyte differentiation were detected. Transcriptomics data indicate that synaptic function is impaired in PD specific midbrain organoids. This is further confirmed by alterations in synapse number and electrophysiological activity. We found that synaptic decline precedes neurodegeneration. Finally, this study substantiates that patient specific midbrain organoids allow a personalized phenotyping, which make them an interesting tool for precision medicine and drug discovery. However, its pathogenic accumulation and aggregation results in toxicity and neurodegeneration.",6

Intratumoral heterogeneity contributes to therapeutic resistance, with roles for stem cell-like brain tumor initiating cells (GBMs), glioma associated macrophages (GAMs), and communication between them. GAMs are derived from infiltrating lymphocytes, and monocyte migration is increased by GBM cell release of extracellular vesicles, including exosomes. GBM survival is promoted by the glucose transporter GLUT3, which was recently shown to alter macrophage activation states. We found that GBM-derived exosomes contain GLUT3 and that exosomes from GLUT3 expressing GBMs significantly increased monocyte migration in comparison to controls. Monocytes transfected with GLUT3 (but not GLUT1) also had significantly increased migration, demonstrating a direct role for GLUT3 in monocytes migration. Analysis of the transcriptome of exosome treated monocytes demonstrated that exosomes derived from GLUT3 expressing GBMs increasedGDF-15in monocytes. GDF-15 is a known regulator of monocyte migration, and we determined that knockdown of GDF-15 blocked the migration induced by GBM-derived exosomes. As GDF-15 induced monocyte migration is thought to involve MMP12, we next evaluated MMP12 as a potential mediator of the pro-migratory phenotype.MMP12was significantly increased in monocytes upon treatment with exosomes derived from GLUT3 expressing GBMs as was MMP12 activity. Together, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which GBMs facilitate immune evasion and tumor progression: GBM-derived exosomes transfer GLUT3 to monocytes to increase a GDF-15/MMP12 pathway that promotes monocyte migration.

Phenotypes of anoikis resistant cancer cells have been extensively investigated, however, how exposure to suspension stress may lead to acquisition of a anoikis resistance phenotype has not been previously described in detail.  Here we show using a spectrum of ovarian cancer cells, that cycles of suspension stress followed by attached growth, leads to adaptation and acquisition of resistance to cell death in suspension . Comparing the stepwise transcriptomic changes as cells acquire resistance, we find strong transcriptional reprogramming in the population with a majority of differentially expressed genes being downregulated during progressive acquisition of anoikis resistance. Adapted anoikis resistant cells display an enhanced dependency on oxidative phosphorylation and are capable of evasion from T cell-mediated immune surveillance. We find that such acquired anoikis resistance is not genetic. However, transcriptional reprogramming is essential to this process as acquisition of such adaptive anoikis resistance invitro and invivo are both exquisitely sensitive to specific inhibition of transcriptional reprogramming. Our data demonstrate that recovery from the verge of anoikis leads to adaptation that promotes metastasis in ovarian cancer, but can be therapeutically prevented by specific inhibitors to transcriptional reprogramming.",34

Cytoplasmic FUS accumulation is recapitulated in the frontal cortex and spinal cord of heterozygous Fus∆NLS/+ mice. We show that in these mice, the hippocampus, a critical structure involved in learning and memory, paradoxically displays nuclear FUS accumulation. FUS binds to a set of genes characterized by the presence of an ETS/ELK-binding motifs, and involved in RNA metabolism, transcription, ribosome/mitochondria and chromatin organization. Importantly, hippocampal nuclei showed a decompaction of the neuronal chromatin at highly expressed genes and an inappropriate transcriptomic response was observed after spatial training of Fus∆NLS/+ mice.

Therefore, it is important to identify new therapeutic targets for OS. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been reported to participate in tumor malignancy. In this study, functional screening found that the m6A demethylase FTO could be a candidate therapeutic target for OS. Upregulated FTO in OS could predict a poorer prognosis. FTO promoted the growth and metastasis of OS in vitro and in vivo. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed to identify DACT1 as a potential target of FTO. In vitro assays demonstrated that FTO could reduce the mRNA stability of DACT1 via m6A demethylation, which decreased DACT1 expression and further activated the Wnt signaling pathway. The oncogenic effect of FTO on OS was dependent on DACT1. In addition, the m6A reader IGF2BP1 was validated to participate in the regulation of DACT1. Entacapone, a conventional drug for Parkinson's disease, was confirmed to suppress OS via m6A-mediated regulation through the FTO/DACT1 axis.

Loss of CMTM4 significantly reduced tumor growth and impaired NFB, mTOR, PI3K/Akt pathway activation. Interestingly, we found that CMTM4 can regulate epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling post-translationally by promoting EGFR recycling and preventing its degradation through Rab proteins. Consequentially, CMTM4 knockout promoted response sensitivity of human tumor cells to EGFR inhibitors. Importantly, CMTM4 knockout tumors stimulated with EGF significantly decreased their production of inflammatory cytokines including G-CSF, leading to decreased recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells and thus, a less suppressive tumor-immune-environment. Therapeutically, siRNA-liposome targeting CMTM4 reduced tumor growth in vivo and prolonged animal survival.

We discovered that the master splicing factor and cell-cycle modulator, CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1), is aberrantly spliced in HGGs to include exon 4, resulting in a gain of two phosphorylation sites and subsequent activation of CLK1. Inhibition of CLK1 with Cirtuvivint in the pediatric HGG KNS-42 cell line significantly decreased both cell viability and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Morpholino-mediated depletion of CLK1 exon 4 splicing reduced RNA expression, protein abundance, and cell viability. Notably, KNS-42 cells treated with the CLK1 exon 4 morpholino demonstrated differential expression impacting 173 cancer genes and differential splicing with loss or gain of a functional site in 529 cancer genes. These genes were enriched for cancer-associated pathways, with 20 identified as significant gene dependencies in pediatric HGGs. Our findings highlight a dependency of pediatric HGGs on CLK1 and its roles contributing to tumor splicing heterogeneity through transcriptional dysregulation of splicing factors and direct transcriptional modulation of oncogenes. Overall, aberrant splicing in HGGs and other pediatric brain tumors represents a potentially targetable oncogenic pathway contributing to tumor growth and maintenance. Continued investigation of these mechanisms is essential for developing new effective treatment strategies for these patients.",6

However, the critical intratumoural microbiota and its role in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression has not been fully elucidated. Results: Herein, we reveal significant abnormalities in the intratumoural microbiota of NSCLC by analyzing the microbiota profiles of tumor and non-malignant tissues from NSCLC patients. Specifically, Gram-negative bacteria were significantly increased in intratumoural bacteria, and network analysis revealed that Escherichia-Shigella and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae, which had strong ability to synthesize bacterial toxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS), could significantly promote tumor proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that Escherichia-Shigella and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae-derived LPS activated the TLR4-mTOR-NF-κB-IL-6 axis to facilitate the proliferation of NSCLC, while rapamycin could effectively postpone LPS-induced tumor proliferation through in vitro cell culture and in vivo murine model. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the combined diagnosis of intratumoural bacterial concentration, Escherichia-Shigella, and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae had higher diagnostic validity than the individual diagnosis in predicting the probability of NSCLC, and their detection in blood has the potential to be combined with imaging for non-invasive diagnosis of NSCLC. Conclusions: Collectively, this research discovered increased Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia-Shigella, and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae in NSCLC tumors, and clarified the mechanism of these bacteria-derived LPS in promoting tumor development, providing new strategies for the treatment and diagnosis of NSCLC from a microbial perspective.",9

However, both primary and acquired resistance to immunotherapy, emerged during the co-evolution of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), commonly restrain long-term tumor control. In exploring the oncogenic activity of Ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), we unexpectedly discovered that this epigenetic regulator exhibits altered expression and aberrant cytosolic localization in cancerous tissues. Cytoplasmic translocation of UHRF1 is induced by its phosphorylation on a specific serine in response to signals provided by factors present in the TME, such as TGF-, enabling UHRF1 to bind MHC-I and promote its ubiquitination and degradation via the E3 activity of UHRF1. Down-regulation of MHC-I results in suppression of the antigen presentation pathway to establish a non-T cell-inflamed TME favoring tumor growth. Genetic deletion of UHRF1 synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment and induces an anti-tumor memory response by evoking low-affinity T cells upon sustained UHRF1 inactivation. Our study unveils a novel function of UHRF1 in cancer immune evasion and provides a potential target to synergize with immunotherapy and overcome immunotherapeutic resistance.",33

However, MPE is a frequently occurring manifestation of advanced cancer and is often associated with a poor prognosis. While current treatment options for MPE can provide palliative care, alternative therapies are urgently needed. To investigate this role, eosinophil counts were determined using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Eosinophil-deficient mice (Eos-null) and Cd3δ -promoter Il5 transgenic (Il5 Tg) mice were subjected to a mouse model of MPE. Eosinophils were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and their transcriptional profile was obtained by RNA sequencing. Finally, we evaluated the effects of the C-C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) and a C-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) axis on MPE pathology using recombinant mouse CCL11 and a CCR3 inhibitor. In humans, eosinophil counts were increased in MPE and negatively correlated with the LENT score. In animal models, eosinophils were rapidly recruited to the pleural cavity when challenged with tumor cells. Interestingly, eosinophil deficiency worsened MPE, while an increase in eosinophils through various methods improved MPE. Furthermore, the recruitment of eosinophils may be influenced by the CCL11-CCR3 axis. Taken together, the study highlights the protective role of eosinophils against MPE formation, indicating their potential as a therapeutic strategy. Moreover, the CCL11-CCR3 axis may be a viable target for MPE treatment.",4
"GSE282865","Drosophila melanogaster","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Transcriptomic analysis of methylmercury effects on Drosophila flight muscle and ventral nerve cord development","The greatest concern for exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) lies with the fetus and young children, as exemplified in historic cases of Congenital Minamata Disease (CMD) resulting from prenatal exposure. Children that experience CMD characteristically present with various degrees of cognitive and motor symptoms and signs, much like cerebral palsy.  MeHg has thus been characterized as a neurotoxicant, where motor deficits are ascribed to central nervous system targets. Skeletal muscle as a post-synaptic MeHg target and contributor to the etiology of CMD has garnered far less attention.  Prior studies using Drosophila to model CMD revealed that developmental exposure of MeHg in the larval/pupal stages can elicit graded and latent dose responses affecting adult flight behavior at lower doses (0.4-2.5 ppm in food) and eclosion (emergence from the pupa case) at higher doses (>2.5 ppm in food).  The latter phenotype is accompanied by dysmorphogenesis of skeletal muscles. Here, we investigate respective roles for muscle and neural targets in MeHg toxicity. Using RNA-seq analysis, we find that developmental MeHg exposure produces 10-times as many differentially expressed transcripts in indirect flight muscle (IFM) compared to the VNC. Among known MeHg response genes, Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway genes showed muscle-specific MeHg-induced expression changes. Within the muscle transcriptome, the most enriched and significant Gene Ontology terms identified genes required for mitochondrial ribosomal translation at the pupa stage and mitochondrial function (respiratory chain complex I) and vesicle trafficking (ESCRT III) pathways in adults, all showing decreased expression with MeHg exposure. By using an intact, whole-animal developmental model, we identify preferential candidates to evaluate a novel role for muscle-specific mitochondria and intercellular vesicular communication mechanisms as targets in MeHg toxicity and the etiology of CMD.",24

RNA seq results showed a significant increase in piezo1 after primary neuron OGD/R, and iron death data was also enriched. Moreover, inhibiting LOX or piezo1 can rescue neuronal ferroptosis and further improve cognitive function in rats. In addition, we also found that traumatic acid can inhibit the enzyme activity of LOX and improve a series of pathological features of neuronal damage caused by increased LOX.",6

In this study, we first demonstrated that TYW1 loss blocked the formation of OHyW in tRNAphe, therefore affected the translation efficiency of UUU codon. Using the brain organoid model, we showed impaired neuron differentiation when TYW1 was depleted. Interestingly, retrotransposons were differentially regulated in TYW1-/- hESCs. In particular, one kind of human-specific endogenous retrovirus-K (HERVK/HML2), whose reactivation impaired human neurodevelopment, was significantly up-regulated in TYW1-/- hESCs. Consistently, a UUU codon enriched protein, SMARCAD1, which was a key factor in controlling endogenous retroviruses was reduced. Taken together, TYW1 loss leads to upregulation of HERVK in hESCs by down-regulated SMARCAD1, thus impairing neuron differentiation.",6

However, the prenatal phenotypes of 16p11.2 copy number variations (CNVs) are still not well described till now. This study aimed to provide an elaborate summary of intrauterine phenotypic features for such genomic disorders.     Methods: Twenty prenatal amniotic fluid samples diagnosed with 16p11.2 microdeletions/microduplications were obtained from pregnant women who opted for invasive prenatal testing. Karyotypic analysis and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) were performed in parallel. The pregnancy outcomes and health conditions after birth for all cases were followed up. Meanwhile, we made a pooled analysis on the prenatal phenotypes for the published cases carrying 16p11.2 CNVs.     Results: 20 fetuses (20/20884, 0.10%) with 16p11.2 CNVs were identified: five 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion, ten 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion and five 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 duplication. Abnormal ultrasound findings were recorded in ten participants with 16p11.2 deletions.Various degrees of intrauterine phenotypic features, ranging from normal to abnormal, were observed. No ultrasound abnormalities were observed for all 16p11.2 duplication cases during the pregnancy period. For 16p11.2 deletions, eleven cases terminated their pregnancies. For 16p11.2 duplications, four cases gave birth to healthy neonates except one was lost to follow up.    Conclusions: Diverse prenatal phenotypes were presented in 16p11.2 CNVs, ranging from normal to abnormal. For 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion, the most common structural and non-structural abnormalities were the abnormality of the vertebral column or rib and thickened nuchal translucency, respectively. 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion might be closely associated with fetal growth restriction and single umbilical artery. No representative ultrasound findings for 16p11.2 duplication were observed till now. Considering the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance of 16p11.2 CNVs, long term follow up after birth should be carried out for these cases.

A common genetic variant in humans (MTHFR 677C>T), results in reduced enzyme activity and has been linked to various disorders, including male infertility. A new animal model has been created by reproducing the human equivalent of the polymorphism in mice using CRISPR/Cas9. Biochemical parameters in the Mthfr 677TT mice recapitulate alterations found in MTHFR 677TT men. Our aims were to: 1) characterize the sperm DNA methylome of the Mthfr 677CC and TT mice on a control diet (2mg folic acid/kg diet) and 2) assess the effects of folic acid deficiency (0.3mg/kg diet) and supplementation (10 mg/kg diet) on the sperm DNA methylome. Body and reproductive organ weights, testicular sperm counts, and histology were examined. DNA methylation in sperm was assessed using bisulfite pyrosequencing, Illumina Mouse Methylation Array and whole genome bisulfite sequencing. Reproductive parameters and imprinted gene methylation were unaffected by genotype or diets. The largest effect was due to genotype, with sperm from 677TT mice showing more hypo- than hypermethylation. Folate-deficient diets resulted in sperm hyper- and hypomethylation in CC and TT mice. Folic acid supplementation caused mostly hypermethylation in sperm of males of both genotypes and was found to partially correct the DNA methylation alterations in sperm associated with the TT genotype. The new mouse model will be useful in understanding the role of MTHFR deficiency in male fertility and in designing folate supplementation regimens for the clinic.",24

Methods: Twenty-six prenatal amniotic fluid samples diagnosed with 1q21.1 microdeletions/microduplications were obtained from pregnant women who opted for invasive prenatal testing. Karyotypic analysis and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) were performed for all cases simultaneously. The pregnancy outcomes and health conditions after birth for all cases were followed up. Meanwhile, prenatal cases with 1q21.1 microdeletions or microduplications in the literature were retrospectively collected.  Results: Eleven pregnancies (11/8252, 0.13%) with 1q21.1 microdeletions and fifteen (15/8252, 0.18%) with 1q21.1 microduplications were identified. Among these 1q21.1 CNVs, four cases covered thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) region, sixteen cases covered 1q21.1 recurrent microdeletion/microduplication region, and six cases covered all regions mentioned above. The prenatal abnormal ultrasound findings were recorded in four participants with 1q21.1 deletions and seven participants with 1q21.1 duplications. Finally, three cases with 1q21.1 deletions and five with 1q21.1 duplications terminated their pregnancies.  Conclusion: 1q21.1 microdeletions were associated with increased nuchal translucency (NT), anomalies of urinary system and cardiovascular abnormalities, and 1q21.1 microduplications were correlated with cardiovascular malformations, nasal bone dysplasia and increased NT in prenatal setting. In addition, cerebral ventriculomegaly might be correlated with 1q21.1 microduplications. Considering the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance of 1q21.1 CNVs, long term follow up after birth should be carried out for these cases.

To gain greater insight into the unique neuromotor features, we performed gene expression profiling of the motor cortex of a well-characterized murine model of the disorder. Co-expression network analysis suggested an abnormality with myelination, which was supported by limited existing human data. Utilizing electron microscopy, marked dysmyelination was detected in 2-week-old homozygous ARG1 knockout mice. The corticospinal tract was found to be adversely affected, supporting dysmyelination as the cause of the unique neuromuscular features and implicating oligodendrocyte impairment in a deficiency of hepatic ARG1. Following neonatal hepatic gene therapy to express ARG1, the subcortical white matter, pyramidal tract, and corticospinal tract all showed a remarkable recovery in terms of myelinated axon density and ultrastructural integrity with active wrapping of axons by nearby oligodendrocyte processes. These findings support the following conclusions: first, arginase deficiency is a leukodystrophy affecting the brain and spinal cord while sparing the peripheral nervous system; and second, neonatal AAV hepatic gene therapy can rescue the defects associated with myelinated axons, strongly implicating the functional recovery of oligodendrocytes after restoration of hepatic arginase activity.

The mucosa consists of epithelial cells connected by cellular junctions that regulate the passage of nutrients covered by a mucus layer that plays an important role in host-microbiome interactions. Mimicking the intestinal mucosa for in vitro assays, in particular the generation of a viscous mucus layer, has proven to be challenging. Here, we present a novel in vitro intestinal culture model that produces a robust mucus layer and is based on the widely used intestinal Caco-2 cell line. We investigated the effects of air-liquid interface (ALI) culturing compared to liquid-liquid interface (LLI) on Caco-2 cells grown under low-glucose conditions in Transwell plates. In addition, we determined the impact of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) on mucus secretion, epithelial barrier properties and microbe-mucus interactions. A combination of ALI culturing with VIP addition led to formation of a robust mucus layer on the apical surface of the Caco-2 confluent layer in which the intestinal secreted mucin MUC2 was a major component. RNAseq analysis demonstrated upregulation of unique gene clusters in response to ALI and VIP conditions, but the ALI-VIP combination treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of multiple mucin genes and proteins including MUC2, MUC13 and MUC17. Expression of tight junction proteins was significantly altered in the ALI-VIP condition leading to increased permeability to small molecules, more closely reflecting an intestinal epithelium permissive for nutrient uptake. In infection experiments with commensal Lactobacillus plantarum, pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the ALI-VIP mucus layer separated the bacteria from the underlying epithelium.

Considering the individual differences in response to stress, however, approaches for exercise treatment as an antidepressant and anxiolytic intervention are also not exempt from variability in effectiveness among individuals, and insight into the biology of those variations can be gained by examining the individual adaptation to exercise. Here, we investigated the efficacy of voluntary wheel running (VWR) exercise as a disease-modifying intervention for stress-susceptible (SS) mice subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRST). Multidimensional behavior analysis revealed significant variability in the efficacy of VWR among individuals, with some mice showing substantial behavior phenotypic improvements (e.g., behavior despair, anhedonia, aversion to open space, and compulsive behavior) (SES) while others displayed limited or no benefits (SER). Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), a critical brain region involved in emotional regulation and processing, demonstrated that SES mice exhibited molecular signatures promoting adaptive changes by restoring cellular repair, energy availability, and synaptic plasticity observed in SS mice, whereas SER mice exhibited limited behavior resilience and distinct transcriptomic profiles enriched in structural adaptation without functional resilience and glia cell differentiation, particularly marked by astrocyte activation or differentiation. These findings suggest that while VWR can alleviate multiple concurrent behavior symptoms in stress-susceptible mice; however, its efficacy is influenced by distinct biological processes. Collectively, our work highlights the importance of a multivariate framework for behavior assessment and genetic underpinnings to better understand the often-overlooked variability in response to stress and the therapeutic efficacy of exercise in stress-related disorders.",12

We observed distinct proteomic dynamics before and around zygotic genome activation (ZGA) between the two species. Integrative analysis with translatome data revealed extensive divergence between translation activation and protein accumulation. Multi-omic analysis indicated that ZGA transcripts contribute to protein accumulation in blastocysts. Consequently, we identified several transcriptional regulators critical for early development in mice, thereby linking ZGA to the first lineage specification. Furthermore, single-embryo proteomics of poor quality embryos from over 100 patient-couples provided insights into preimplantation development failure.

Conventional understanding holds that SHM enhances pre-existing antibody specificities, limiting the scope of SHM-based antibody evolution to those established in the primary repertoire through V(D)J recombination. By tracking pre-defined non-specific B cells, we observed consistent SHM in non-cognate antibody genes after immunization in settings of diverse, polyclonal B and T cells. Removing B cell competition enabled these non-specific yet somatically mutating antibodies to develop entirely new specificities to diverse antigens. Our findings introduce an updated model, where SHM drives antibody diversification without requiring initial antigen specificity. This reveals that B cell competition, rather than a necessity for specific affinity, limits the emergence of new affinities (termed here as affinity birth) by SHM and highlights the mammalian adaptive immune system’s capacity to explore antibody-antigen interactions beyond the epitopes targeted by the V(D)J-dependent primary antibody repertoire.",8

After MI, the DNA methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) of Pw1 gene in the injured area was reduced and both alleles of Pw1 in fibroblasts are activated. Further, loss of Pw1 in fibroblasts can enhance cardiac function, reduce cardiac fibrosis and extracellular matrix secretion after cardiac injury. To screen the targets of PW1, we contrasted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and RNA-seq using the injured left ventricles at 7 days post-MI, we next found PW1 binds directly upstream of the Pfas gene that encodes one of the DNPB enzymes phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS) in heart after injury. Similarly, specific knockout of pfas in fibroblasts also improves cardiac function and reduces ECM production.

However, the role of miRNAs in such processes remains elusive. Here, we show that pancreatic islet miR-27a-5p, which is markedly increased in obese mice and impairs insulin secretion, is mainly delivered by visceral adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Depleting miR-27a-5p significantly improves insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in db/db mice. Supporting the function of EVs’ miR-27a-5p as a key pathogenic factor, intravenous injection of miR-27a-5p-containing EVs shows their distribution in mouse pancreatic islets. Tracing the injected AAV-miR-27a-5p (AAV-miR-27a) or AAV-FABP4-miR-27a-5p (AAV-FABP4-miR-27a) in visceral fat results in upregulating miR-27a-5p in EVs and serum, and elicits mouse pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, miR-27a-5p directly targets L-type Ca2+ channel subtype CaV1.2 (Cacna1c) and reduces insulin secretion in β-cells.

The ability of these cells to elude immune surveillance determines their persistence as latent disease. We report that TGF-β promotes dormancy in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mouse models by placing disseminated SOX2+ and NKX2-1+ progenitors in a quiescent state that biomechanically averts killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. In these primitive progenitors, TGF-β induces an atypical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β drives expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin that changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the stiffness of metastatic progenitors and their killing by mechanosensitive CTLs and NK cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors activate a biomechanical process to evade immune-mediated elimination during prolonged dormancy periods.

To decipher the oral epithelial cell responses to arsenic and SLT alone and in co-exposure, we performed multi-omics analyses of DNA methylome, transcriptomic reprogramming and genotoxic effects in controlled experimental settings. Chronic exposure studies revealed hypomethylation of genes involved in inflammation response and apoptosis, further corroborated by the upregulation of genes involved in these processes due to arsenic and the combined treatment in acute exposure setting.

Cell states are defined by their epigenetic landscape and have cell state-specific metabolic demands. Defining the regulatory factors involved in the interplay between metabolism and cell state would represent a significant step forward in understanding the genetic circuitry that drives differentiation of progenitor cells into highly specialized cell types for proper tissue formation. Expression levels of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) mega-cluster have been shown to correlate with distinct metabolic profiles in a variety of progenitor cells, suggesting it functions as a key regulator of metabolism and cell state. Here, we directly demonstrate that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a central player coordinating mitochondrial metabolic activity and genome-wide epigenetic changes in myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Stable muscle cell lines were generated harboring two distinct deletions in the proximal promoter region resulting in either greatly upregulated or severely attenuated transcription of the entire mega-cluster of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. Both mutant lines displayed impaired myotube formation along with perturbed mitochondrial respiration and widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and histone methylation. Global gene expression patterns and pathway analyses indicated a reprogramming of cell state which created a differentiated-like molecular profile in proliferating myoblasts.

Viral genomes are recruited to PML NBs structures and chromatinized by repressive H3.3K9me3 modified H3.3 histone variant to form viral DNA-containing PML-NBs (vDCP NBs). Exactly how this occurs is unclear. Here we identify an essential role for the HUSH complex and its SETDB1 and MORC2 effectors in the establishment and maintenance of latent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. ChIP-seq analyses conducted on latently/quiescently infected primary human fibroblasts highlight the association of the H3K9me3 mark with the entire viral genome. We demonstrate the necessity of HUSH, SETDB1, and MORC2 in the establishment of repressive heterochromatin in vDCP NBs. Depletion of these components prior to viral infection results in reduced H3K9me3 levels across the entirety of latent/quiescent HSV-1 genomes, with minimal impact on the cellular genome as a whole. Once latency is established, depletion of HUSH, SETDB1, or MORC2 by shRNAs or the HIV-2ROD Vpx protein, induces the reactivation of HSV-1 in infected primary human fibroblasts as well as in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons (hiPSDN). We discovered that the viral protein ICP0 induces MORC2 degradation via the proteasome machinery. This process is concurrent with ICP0 capability to initiate full HSV-1 reactivation, as well as the significant reactivation of HSV-1 upon MORC2 depletion in hiPSDN.

RNAi mediated by virus-specific dsRNA is the main antiviral defense mechanism in plants, but nonspecific dsRNA-triggered responses have been documented to play a role in antiviral defense. Using PVX as a model, we have determined that co-inoculation with either virus-specific or nonspecific dsRNA reduced virus accumulation in both inoculated and systemic leaves although at different extent. While the administration of dsRNA specific for the targeted virus induced a potent RNAi-based antiviral response that resulted in highly effective control of viral disease, the degree of interference with PVX-GFP infection afforded by nonspecific dsRNA (PTI) was limited. To identify early biological processes and pathways associated with dsRNA-based immunity, we conducted a global transcriptome RNAseq assay from N. benthamiana leaves inoculated with four different treatments, i.e., dsGFP alone (dsG), PVX-GFP combined with dsGFP (dsG_VG), wild-type (Wt) PVX combined with dsGFP (dsG_V) and bacterial nucleic acid extracts not expressing dsRNA as a control (Ctr). KEGG analysis of differentially expressed genes showed a significant enrichment of terms related to plant-pathogen signaling pathways (KEGG terms Plant-pathogen interaction and MAPK signaling) in all the three treatments with dsRNA.

This process is markedly reduced during aging, which might contribute to the cognitive decline of elderly subjects. Recent studies suggest that the aged niche environment may decrease the pool of proliferating neural/stem progenitor cells (NSPCs), and hence adult neurogenesis, by causing transcriptomic changes that favour NSC quiescence over activation. The transcription factors that mediate these changes, however, remain largely unclear. We previously found that the homeobox gene Dbx2 is upregulated in NSPCs of the aged mouse SVZ and can inhibit the growth of young adult NSPC cultures. Here, we show that Dbx2 expression is downregulated by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor signalling, which promotes NSPC proliferation and decreases in the aged SVZ. By means of transgenic NSPC lines, we also show that Dbx2 inhibits NSPC proliferation by hindering the G1/S and the G2/M transition. Furthermore, we exploit RNA sequencing of transgenic NSPCs to elucidate the transcriptional networks modulated by Dbx2. Among the top hits, we report the downregulation of several gene categories implicated in cell cycle progression. Accordingly, we find that Dbx2 function is negatively correlated with the transcriptional signatures of proliferative NSPCs (aNSCs, TAPs and early NBs). Altogether, these results point to Dbx2 as a potential molecular node relaying the extracellular anti-neurogenic input of the aged niche to the NSPC transcriptome.",16

In this study, aiming to explore the role of neddylation in male infertility, we used the specific neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 for treatment in mouse type B spermatogonia GC-2 cells.

Patients with mild or moderate PKU can be successfully treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride (SD) which since recently is registered for usage from the age of 4 months. SD is a pharmaceutical version of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor of PAH. Similar BH4 concentrations to those observed in plasma have been found in CSF of patients after a single oral administration thus proving that SD crosses the BBB. Hyperactivity has recently been reported as a post-marketing observation in some PKU patients treated with SD. Methods: 60 or 120 ng/ml sepiapterin, a stable precursor of BH4, were applied to study the effects of BH4 on developing brain cells in 3D organotypic rat brain cell cultures at two developmental stages. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, metabolomics and RNA sequencing were performed. Findings: BH4 and BH2 measurements confirmed a successful conversion of sepiapterin to the active form BH4. In the earlier developmental stage, brain cell specific markers showed swollen astrocytes and diminished astrocytic fibres, delayed differentiation of oligodendrocytes and perturbation of axonal elongation. Immunofluorescence for activated caspase-3 revealed an increased apoptosis rate. We also found signs of perturbated GABAergic neurotransmission. RNAseq analyses revealed a number of significantly affected genes. GO enrichment allowed to identify key biological processes. Interestingly, none of these effects was observed in the later developmental stage. We show deleterious effects of SD on developing brain cells in a rat in vitro model. This observation raises the question whether the use of SD can be recommended in very young PKU patients as currently licensed.",23

We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in uninfected and BCG infected macrophages that were either deficient in iNOS (Nos2-/- vs C57bl6/J) or BH4/Gch1 (GCHfl/flTie2cre vs GCHfl/fl)",31
"GSE55148","Mus musculus","Expression profiling by array","Mildly compromised tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis mouse mutants exhibit abnormal body fat distribution and abdominal obesity","Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for several metabolic enzymes, including the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, alkylglycerol mono-oxygenase and NO synthases. BH4 deficiency due to an autosomal recessive defect in its biosynthetic enzyme 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS, encoded by the PTS gene) leads to a variant form of hyperphenylalaninemia concomitant with severe deficiency of brain monoamine neurotransmitters. In contrast, augmentation of BH4 by pharmacological supplementation or stimulation of its biosynthesis is thought to correct eNOS dysfunction, to protect from (cardio) vascular disease and/or to prevent from abdominal obesity and development of the metabolic syndrome. We have previously reported that complete Pts knock-out (ko) mice die after birth (Elzaouk et al JBC 2003). Here we generated a murine Pts-knock-in (ki) allele expressing a PTPS-p.Arg15Cys mutant enzyme with low residual activity (12% of wild-type in vitro) and investigated heterozygous Pts-ko/wt, homozygous Pts-ki/ki and compound heterozygous Pts-ki/ko mutant mice. All mice were viable and, depending on the severity of the Pts alleles, exhibited up to 90% reduction of PTPS activity in liver and brain tissues concomitant with high neopterin, but neither an elevation of blood L-Phe, nor a decrease in brain monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine or serotonin. Upon a standard systemic and comprehensive phenotyping of Pts-ki/ki mice, we found alterations in energy metabolites with reduced body mass, higher fat content, lower lean mass, and increased blood glucose and cholesterol in mutant animals. Furthermore, heterozygous Pts-ko/wt and/or homozygous Pts-ki/ki mice exhibited increased body weight and elevated intra-abdominal fat tissue when fed with normal chow or high fat diet. We conclude that a reduced BH4-biosynthetic activity in mice leads to abnormal body fat distribution and abdominal obesity potentially through a mildly compromised eNOS function.",16

Here, we report the generation of NLRP3-mutant and non-mutant induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from two CINCA syndrome patients with somatic mosaicism, and describe their differentiation into macrophages (iPS-MPs). We found that mutant cells are predominantly responsible for the pathogenesis in these mosaic patients because only mutant iPS-MPs showed the disease relevant phenotype of abnormal IL-1β secretion. We also confirmed that the existing anti-inflammatory compounds inhibited the abnormal IL-1β secretion, indicating that mutant iPS-MPs are applicable for drug screening for CINCA syndrome and other NLRP3-related inflammatory conditions. Our results illustrate that patient-derived iPSCs are useful for dissecting somatic mosaicism, and that NLRP3-mutant iPSCs can provide a valuable platform for drug discovery for multiple NLRP3-related disorders.",15

Transient expression of Rbfox proteins in radial glial progenitors induces neuronal splicing events preferentially in transcription regulators such as Meis2 and Tead1. Surprisingly, Rbfox proteins promote the inclusion of a mammal-specific alternative exon and a previously undescribed poison exon in Ptbp1. Simultaneous ablation of Rbfox1/2/3 in the neocortex downregulates neuronal isoforms and disrupts radial neuronal migration.

The mucosa consists of epithelial cells connected by cellular junctions that regulate the passage of nutrients covered by a mucus layer that plays an important role in host-microbiome interactions. Mimicking the intestinal mucosa for in vitro assays, in particular the generation of a viscous mucus layer, has proven to be challenging. Here, we present a novel in vitro intestinal culture model that produces a robust mucus layer and is based on the widely used intestinal Caco-2 cell line. We investigated the effects of air-liquid interface (ALI) culturing compared to liquid-liquid interface (LLI) on Caco-2 cells grown under low-glucose conditions in Transwell plates. In addition, we determined the impact of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) on mucus secretion, epithelial barrier properties and microbe-mucus interactions. A combination of ALI culturing with VIP addition led to formation of a robust mucus layer on the apical surface of the Caco-2 confluent layer in which the intestinal secreted mucin MUC2 was a major component. RNAseq analysis demonstrated upregulation of unique gene clusters in response to ALI and VIP conditions, but the ALI-VIP combination treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of multiple mucin genes and proteins including MUC2, MUC13 and MUC17. Expression of tight junction proteins was significantly altered in the ALI-VIP condition leading to increased permeability to small molecules, more closely reflecting an intestinal epithelium permissive for nutrient uptake. In infection experiments with commensal Lactobacillus plantarum, pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the ALI-VIP mucus layer separated the bacteria from the underlying epithelium. In conclusion, ALI-VIP culture of Caco-2 cells provides an attractive in vitro model to study the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier and pathogenic and commensal microbe-host interactions.",17

By tracking pre-defined non-specific B cells, we observed consistent SHM in non-cognate antibody genes after immunization in settings of diverse, polyclonal B and T cells. Removing B cell competition enabled these non-specific yet somatically mutating antibodies to develop entirely new specificities to diverse antigens. Our findings introduce an updated model, where SHM drives antibody diversification without requiring initial antigen specificity. This reveals that B cell competition, rather than a necessity for specific affinity, limits the emergence of new affinities (termed here as affinity birth) by SHM and highlights the mammalian adaptive immune system’s capacity to explore antibody-antigen interactions beyond the epitopes targeted by the V(D)J-dependent primary antibody repertoire.",8

Syndecans (SDCs) act as communication bridges within the muscle microenvironment, regulating interactions with extracellular matrix components, and contributing significantly to tissue repair and inflammation. Specifically, syndecan-4 (SDC4) is involved in muscle regeneration at multiple stages. Methods: This study delves into the emerging challenge of wooden breast (WB) myopathy and its connection to SDC4. Our hypothesis proposes that disruptions in MuSC dynamics through SDC4 contribute to the increased incidence of breast myopathies observed in growing broilers. To test our hypothesis, non-affected and affected broilers were systematically selected, and the characteristics of WB myopathy were studied both in vitro and in vivo. SDC4 overexpression in MuSCs and blocking peptides corresponding to the SDC4 ectodomain were used for investigation of the role of SDC4 in muscle development and its shedding levels. Results and Discussion: Examination in vivo of affected muscles revealed smaller fibers and changes in metabolic pathways. In vitro studies unveiled disrupted proliferation of MuSCs in WB myopathy, accompanied by downregulation of several muscle markers. Investigation of a potentially role of SDC4 in the pathogenesis of WB myopathy revealed a decreased tendency in SDC4 gene expression and increased shedding of its ectodomain. Moreover, we showed that SDC4 overexpression is linked to decreased proliferation in MuSCs and affected myogenesis. We detected the impairment proliferation of WB-affected MuSCs, revealing critical insights into the dysfunctional state of these cells in myopathy. Additionally, by treating MuSCs with blocking peptides derived from the SDC4 ectodomain, we identified altered proliferation.  Taken together, this work contributes valuable knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying WB myopathy and role of SDC4 in this chicken myopathy.",20

After MI, the DNA methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) of Pw1 gene in the injured area was reduced and both alleles of Pw1 in fibroblasts are activated. Further, loss of Pw1 in fibroblasts can enhance cardiac function, reduce cardiac fibrosis and extracellular matrix secretion after cardiac injury. To screen the targets of PW1, we contrasted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and RNA-seq using the injured left ventricles at 7 days post-MI, we next found PW1 binds directly upstream of the Pfas gene that encodes one of the DNPB enzymes phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS) in heart after injury. Similarly, specific knockout of pfas in fibroblasts also improves cardiac function and reduces ECM production. Moreover, de novo purine biosynthesis is necessary for ECM production in activated fibroblasts.

We recently assessed in two clinical trials in a preventative setting whether immunity induced with a MUC1 peptide vaccine could reduce high colon cancer risk in individuals with a history of premalignant colon adenomas. In both trials, there were immune responders and non-responders to the vaccine. Here we used PBMC pre-vaccination and 2 weeks after the first vaccine of responders and non-responders selected from both trials to identify early biomarkers of immune response involved in longterm memory generation and prevention of adenoma recurrence. We performed flow cytometry, phosflow, and differential gene expression analyses on PBMCs collected from MUC1 vaccine responders and non-responders pre-vaccination and two weeks after the first of three vaccine doses. MUC1 vaccine responders had higher frequencies of CD4 cells pre-vaccination, increased expression of CD40L on CD8 and CD4 T-cells, and a greater increase in ICOS expression on CD8 T-cells. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that iCOSL, PI3K AKT MTOR, and B-cell signaling pathways are activated early in response to the MUC1 vaccine. We identified six specific transcripts involved in elevated antigen presentation, B-cell activation, and NF-kB1 activation that were directly linked to finding antibody response at week 12. Finally, a model using these transcripts was able to predict non-responders with accuracy. These findings suggest that individuals who can be predicted to respond to the MUC1 vaccine, and potentially other vaccines, have greater readiness in all immune compartments to present and respond to antigens. Predictive biomarkers of MUC1 vaccine response may lead to more effective vaccines tailored to individuals with high risk for cancer but with varying immune fitness.",89

Here, we identified a CD103-expressing CD56+ ILC subset that were associated with a poor proliferative capacity of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in culture. We demonstrate that CD103+CD56+ ILCs isolated directly from tumors represent a distinct ILC population that expressed unique surface markers, transcription factor networks, and transcriptomic profiles compared to CD103-CD56+ NK cells. Using multiple approaches, we found that these CD103+CD56+ ILCs were associated with CD8+ T cells with a reduced expression of GZMB. This study identifies 59 a population of CD103+CD56+ ILCs with potentially inhibitory functions, that are associated with a TME that includes CD8+ T cells with poor anti-tumour activity.

Direct co-culture of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one of the origins of CAFs, with ESCC cell line, led to increased amphiregulin (AREG) expression and secretion in the ESCC cells. Consequently, the expression and phosphorylation of the AREG receptor EGFR were upregulated in co-cultured ESCC cells. Moreover, AREG treatment enhanced ESCC cell survival and migration through the EGFR-Erk/p38 signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis of AREG using human ESCC tissues showed a positive correlation between the intensity of AREG expression in tumor invasive front and the expression level of the CAF marker FAP. Furthermore, bioinformatics database analysis confirmed a significant upregulation of AREG expression in ESCC tissues compared to normal tissues. These findings suggest that AREG is involved in CAF-mediated ESCC progression and could be a novel therapeutic target for ESCC.",1

A crucial factor for modulating the 60S ribosomal subunits is eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6. Release of eIF6 from 60S is essential to permit 60S interactions with 40S. Here, using the N106S mutant of eIF6, we show that disrupting eIF6 interaction with 60S leads to an increase in vacant 80S. It further highlights a dichotomy in the anti-association activity of eIF6 that is distinct from its role in 60S biogenesis and shows that the nucleolar localization of eIF6 is not dependent on uL14-BCCIP interactions. Limiting active ribosomal pools markedly deregulates translation especially in mitosis and leads to chromosome segregation defects, mitotic exit delays and mitotic catastrophe. Ribo-Seq analysis of the eIF6-N106S mutant shows a significant downregulation in the translation efficiencies of mitotic factors and specifically transcripts with long 3′UTRs. eIF6-N106S mutation also limits cancer invasion, and this role is correlated with the overexpression of eIF6 only in high-grade invasive cancers suggesting that deregulation of eIF6 is probably not an early event in cancers. Thus, this study highlights the segregation of eIF6 functions and its role in moderating 80S availability for mitotic translation and cancer progression.",6

However, the role of miRNAs in such processes remains elusive. Here, we show that pancreatic islet miR-27a-5p, which is markedly increased in obese mice and impairs insulin secretion, is mainly delivered by visceral adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Depleting miR-27a-5p significantly improves insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in db/db mice. Supporting the function of EVs’ miR-27a-5p as a key pathogenic factor, intravenous injection of miR-27a-5p-containing EVs shows their distribution in mouse pancreatic islets. Tracing the injected AAV-miR-27a-5p (AAV-miR-27a) or AAV-FABP4-miR-27a-5p (AAV-FABP4-miR-27a) in visceral fat results in upregulating miR-27a-5p in EVs and serum, and elicits mouse pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, miR-27a-5p directly targets L-type Ca2+ channel subtype CaV1.2 (Cacna1c) and reduces insulin secretion in β-cells. Overexpressing mouse CaV1.2 largely abolishes the insulin secretion injury induced by miR-27a-5p.

The ability of these cells to elude immune surveillance determines their persistence as latent disease. We report that TGF-β promotes dormancy in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mouse models by placing disseminated SOX2+ and NKX2-1+ progenitors in a quiescent state that biomechanically averts killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. In these primitive progenitors, TGF-β induces an atypical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β drives expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin that changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the stiffness of metastatic progenitors and their killing by mechanosensitive CTLs and NK cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors activate a biomechanical process to evade immune-mediated elimination during prolonged dormancy periods. Inhibiting this process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells.",6

There has been a growing concern about co-exposure to various prevalent lifestyle habits and their role in the enhancement of arsenic toxicity. Smokeless tobacco (SLT) products are extensively consumed in many South Asian countries, where their use frequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To decipher the oral epithelial cell responses to arsenic and SLT alone and in co-exposure, we performed multi-omics analyses of DNA methylome, transcriptomic reprogramming and genotoxic effects in controlled experimental settings. Chronic exposure studies revealed hypomethylation of genes involved in inflammation response and apoptosis, further corroborated by the upregulation of genes involved in these processes due to arsenic and the combined treatment in acute exposure setting. Next, to validate the omics results at the phenotypic level, we observed a dose dependent decrease in cell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes, and an increase in apoptotic cells, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT co-exposure conditions. The observed DNA damage was likely the result of apoptosis induction, as chronic exposure experiments based on whole-exome sequencing did not reveal increased mutagenicity following the arsenic and/or SLT exposure. Our integrative omics study provides insights into both chronic and acute responses to arsenic and SLT co-exposure, with both types of responses converging on some of the same mechanisms. We identified large-scale epigenomic and transcriptomic reprograming associated with arsenic and SLT co-exposure, alongside genotoxic effects presumably manifesting as consequences of apoptosis induction. The findings point to a role of arsenic and SLT in altering key molecular responses, especially in the context of the co-exposure, and call for further studies in humans in the areas of exposure, to validate the observed mechanisms.",16

Defining the regulatory factors involved in the interplay between metabolism and cell state would represent a significant step forward in understanding the genetic circuitry that drives differentiation of progenitor cells into highly specialized cell types for proper tissue formation. Expression levels of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) mega-cluster have been shown to correlate with distinct metabolic profiles in a variety of progenitor cells, suggesting it functions as a key regulator of metabolism and cell state. Here, we directly demonstrate that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a central player coordinating mitochondrial metabolic activity and genome-wide epigenetic changes in myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Stable muscle cell lines were generated harboring two distinct deletions in the proximal promoter region resulting in either greatly upregulated or severely attenuated transcription of the entire mega-cluster of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. Both mutant lines displayed impaired myotube formation along with perturbed mitochondrial respiration and widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and histone methylation. Global gene expression patterns and pathway analyses indicated a reprogramming of cell state which created a differentiated-like molecular profile in proliferating myoblasts.

The mucosa consists of epithelial cells connected by cellular junctions that regulate the passage of nutrients covered by a mucus layer that plays an important role in host-microbiome interactions. Mimicking the intestinal mucosa for in vitro assays, in particular the generation of a viscous mucus layer, has proven to be challenging. Here, we present a novel in vitro intestinal culture model that produces a robust mucus layer and is based on the widely used intestinal Caco-2 cell line. We investigated the effects of air-liquid interface (ALI) culturing compared to liquid-liquid interface (LLI) on Caco-2 cells grown under low-glucose conditions in Transwell plates. In addition, we determined the impact of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) on mucus secretion, epithelial barrier properties and microbe-mucus interactions. A combination of ALI culturing with VIP addition led to formation of a robust mucus layer on the apical surface of the Caco-2 confluent layer in which the intestinal secreted mucin MUC2 was a major component. RNAseq analysis demonstrated upregulation of unique gene clusters in response to ALI and VIP conditions, but the ALI-VIP combination treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of multiple mucin genes and proteins including MUC2, MUC13 and MUC17. Expression of tight junction proteins was significantly altered in the ALI-VIP condition leading to increased permeability to small molecules, more closely reflecting an intestinal epithelium permissive for nutrient uptake. In infection experiments with commensal Lactobacillus plantarum, pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the ALI-VIP mucus layer separated the bacteria from the underlying epithelium. In conclusion, ALI-VIP culture of Caco-2 cells provides an attractive in vitro model to study the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier and pathogenic and commensal microbe-host interactions.",17

Considering the individual differences in response to stress, however, approaches for exercise treatment as an antidepressant and anxiolytic intervention are also not exempt from variability in effectiveness among individuals, and insight into the biology of those variations can be gained by examining the individual adaptation to exercise. Here, we investigated the efficacy of voluntary wheel running (VWR) exercise as a disease-modifying intervention for stress-susceptible (SS) mice subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRST). Multidimensional behavior analysis revealed significant variability in the efficacy of VWR among individuals, with some mice showing substantial behavior phenotypic improvements (e.g., behavior despair, anhedonia, aversion to open space, and compulsive behavior) (SES) while others displayed limited or no benefits (SER). Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), a critical brain region involved in emotional regulation and processing, demonstrated that SES mice exhibited molecular signatures promoting adaptive changes by restoring cellular repair, energy availability, and synaptic plasticity observed in SS mice, whereas SER mice exhibited limited behavior resilience and distinct transcriptomic profiles enriched in structural adaptation without functional resilience and glia cell differentiation, particularly marked by astrocyte activation or differentiation. These findings suggest that while VWR can alleviate multiple concurrent behavior symptoms in stress-susceptible mice; however, its efficacy is influenced by distinct biological processes. Collectively, our work highlights the importance of a multivariate framework for behavior assessment and genetic underpinnings to better understand the often-overlooked variability in response to stress and the therapeutic efficacy of exercise in stress-related disorders.",12

Conventional understanding holds that SHM enhances pre-existing antibody specificities, limiting the scope of SHM-based antibody evolution to those established in the primary repertoire through V(D)J recombination. By tracking pre-defined non-specific B cells, we observed consistent SHM in non-cognate antibody genes after immunization in settings of diverse, polyclonal B and T cells. Removing B cell competition enabled these non-specific yet somatically mutating antibodies to develop entirely new specificities to diverse antigens. Our findings introduce an updated model, where SHM drives antibody diversification without requiring initial antigen specificity. This reveals that B cell competition, rather than a necessity for specific affinity, limits the emergence of new affinities (termed here as affinity birth) by SHM and highlights the mammalian adaptive immune system’s capacity to explore antibody-antigen interactions beyond the epitopes targeted by the V(D)J-dependent primary antibody repertoire.",8

We recently assessed in two clinical trials in a preventative setting whether immunity induced with a MUC1 peptide vaccine could reduce high colon cancer risk in individuals with a history of premalignant colon adenomas. In both trials, there were immune responders and non-responders to the vaccine. Here we used PBMC pre-vaccination and 2 weeks after the first vaccine of responders and non-responders selected from both trials to identify early biomarkers of immune response involved in longterm memory generation and prevention of adenoma recurrence. We performed flow cytometry, phosflow, and differential gene expression analyses on PBMCs collected from MUC1 vaccine responders and non-responders pre-vaccination and two weeks after the first of three vaccine doses. MUC1 vaccine responders had higher frequencies of CD4 cells pre-vaccination, increased expression of CD40L on CD8 and CD4 T-cells, and a greater increase in ICOS expression on CD8 T-cells. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that iCOSL, PI3K AKT MTOR, and B-cell signaling pathways are activated early in response to the MUC1 vaccine. We identified six specific transcripts involved in elevated antigen presentation, B-cell activation, and NF-kB1 activation that were directly linked to finding antibody response at week 12. Finally, a model using these transcripts was able to predict non-responders with accuracy. These findings suggest that individuals who can be predicted to respond to the MUC1 vaccine, and potentially other vaccines, have greater readiness in all immune compartments to present and respond to antigens. Predictive biomarkers of MUC1 vaccine response may lead to more effective vaccines tailored to individuals with high risk for cancer but with varying immune fitness.",89

The effector cells of fibrosis are myofibroblasts, an activated form of fibroblast. In gingiva (gums), fibrotic responses are predominantly hyperproliferative (hyperplasia), where transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is overexpressed, and via canonical signaling pathway acts on gingival fibroblasts to induce fibroproliferative genes such as cellular communications network factor 2 (CCN2). Targeting of TGFβ for therapeutic gain however is challenging due its pleotropic nature, and therefore identifying new and targetable alternatives is warranted. We have shown that mechanical tension as a result of stiff ECM increases TGFβ-driven expression of CCN2 in gingival fibroblasts. We further identified yes-activated protein (YAP1), a mechanosensitive transcription (co)factor that translocate to nucleus in response to mechanical tension in gingival fibroblasts. To test if YAP is the perpetuator of TGFβ-mediated fibroproliferative gene induction, I used celastrol, a recently identified YAP/TAZ (transcriptional co-activator PDZ-binding motif) inhibitor, whose anti-fibrotic potential is not yet elucidated -- projecting it as a potential treatment option for gingival hyperplasia.  Methods: Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) in culture were serum starved overnight and pretreated with 500nM Celastrol or DMSO for 45 minutes followed by stimulation with or without TGFβ1 for 6 hours (RT-PCR) and 24 hours (Western blot). mRNA samples collected at 6 hours were also analysed using BulkRNAsequencing and functional cluster analysis. Celastrol’s capacity to prevent the TGFβ induced proliferation of HGFs was investigated with BrdU cell proliferation assay. Celastrol’s ability to block TGFβ-mediated YAP nuclear localization in HGFs was assessed using immunofluorescent staining of YAP protein.  Results: In response to added TGFβ1, the gene and protein expression of fibrotic marker and mediator CCN2 (a known YAP1 target) was significantly downregulated in the presence of Celastrol. Similarly, of the 1364 genes induced by TGFβ1 (>2-fold), 657 genes showed a >50% decrease in the presence of Celastrol including genes involved in fibrotic responses such as type 4 collagen, interleukin 11, etc., Functional cluster analysis revealed ECM, Wnt/cytokine signaling, focal adhesion clusters induced by added TGFβ1, were downregulated in a Celastrol sensitive fashion. Also, basal level proliferation of HGFs was repressed in the presence of Celastrol. Additionally, Celastrol also successfully blocked TGFβ-mediated nuclear translocation of YAP as seen with immunofluorescence microscopy.  Conclusion: These results are consistent with our hypothesis that targeting YAP/TAZ may be useful in blocking the profibrotic effects of TGFβ and that celastrol or other YAP inhibitors are eligible candidates as a treatment option for gingival hyperplasia.",8

We investigated CD25 regulation and function using a series of mice with deletions spanning STAT5-binding elements. Deleting the upstream super-enhancer region mainly affected constitutive CD25 expression on DN2/DN3 thymocytes and Tregs, with these mice developing autoimmune alopecia, whereas deleting an intronic region decreased IL-2-induced CD25 on peripheral T and NK cells. Thus, distinct super-enhancer elements preferentially control constitutive versus inducible expression in a cell type-specific manner. The mediator-1 coactivator colocalized with specific STAT5-binding sites. Moreover, both upstream and intronic regions had extensive chromatin interactions, and deletion of either region altered the super-enhancer structure in mature T cells.

It is therefore surprising that CRISPR induced loss of all three IP3R isoforms (TKO) in HEK293 and HeLa cell lines yields cells that can survive, grow and divide, albeit more slowly than wild-type cells. In an effort to understand the adaptive mechanisms involved, we have examined the activity of key Ca2+ dependent transcription factors (NFAT, CREB and AP-1) and signaling pathways using luciferase-reporter assays, phosphoprotein immunoblots and whole genome transcriptomic studies. In addition, the diacylglycerol arm of the signaling pathway was investigated with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and siRNA knockdown. The data showed that agonist-mediated NFAT activation was lost but CREB activation was maintained in IP3R TKO cells. Under base-line conditions transcriptome analysis indicated the differential expression of 828 and 311 genes in IP3R TKO HEK293 or HeLa cells, respectively, with only 18 genes being in common. Three main adaptations in TKO cells were identified in this study: 1) increased basal activity of NFAT, CREB and AP-1; 2) an increased reliance on Ca2+- insensitive PKC isoforms; and 3) increased production of reactive oxygen species and upregulation of antioxidant defense enzymes. We suggest that whereas wild-type cells rely on a Ca2+ and DAG signal to respond to stimuli, the TKO cells utilize the adaptations to allow key signaling pathways (e.g. PKC, Ras/MAPK, CREB) to transition to the activated state using a DAG signal alone.",12

OPMD is an autosomal dominant myopathy caused by a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the gene encoding PABPN1. The expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble nuclear aggregates that reduce the levels of the soluble form. Clinical tongue involvement in OPMD has been documented but is poorly understood. Tongue histopathology was investigated in OPMD mouse models using light and electron microscopy. Muscle histopathology was predominantly affected by age. PABPN1 nuclear aggregates were found at moderate levels, whereas deposition of insoluble PABPN1 in blood vessels was already prominent in 4-month-old mice. RNA signatures of the OPMD tongue were enriched for mitochondrial and cytoskeletal genes, suggesting an energy and contractile deficit.  ",8

Multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs), formed by macrophage fusion, typically occur in chronic immune pathologies, including infectious and non-infectious granulomas and the foreign body response, but are also observed in the aging ovary. The function and consequence of ovarian MNGCs remain unknown as their biological activity is highly context-dependent, and their large size has limited their isolation and analysis through technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing. In this study, we define ovarian MNGCs through a deep analysis of their presence across age and species using advanced imaging technologies as well as their unique transcriptome using laser capture microdissection. MNGCs form complex interconnected networks that increase with age in both mouse and nonhuman primate ovaries. MNGCs are characterized by high Gpnmb expression, a putative marker of ovarian and non-ovarian MNGCs. Pathway analysis highlighted functions in apoptotic cell clearance, lipid metabolism, proteolysis, immune processes, and increased oxidative phosphorylation and antioxidant activity. Thus, MNGCs have signatures related to degradative processes, immune function, and high metabolic activity. These processes were enriched in MNGCs compared to primary ovarian macrophages, suggesting discrete functionality. MNGCs express CD4 and colocalize with T-cells, which were enriched in regions of MNGCs, indicative of a close interaction between these immune cell types. These findings implicate MNGCs in modulation of the ovarian immune landscape during aging given their high penetrance and unique molecular signature that supports degradative and immune functions.",12

Keloids are more prevalent in populations with darkly pigmented skin. Links between skin pigmentation and vitamin D production have been established and some studies indicate involvement of vitamin D signalling in keloid pathology. This study assessed the impact of paricalcitol (a selective vitamin D signalling activator) on fibroblasts derived from keloid and normal skin, to further investigate the role and potential clinical relevance of vitamin D signalling in keloid pathology. Analysis of keloid and normal skin tissue using immunohistochemistry demonstrated a significant reduction of nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) in keloid tissue. After treatment with paricalcitol, nuclear VDR was increased in both keloid and normal fibroblasts. RNA sequencing of normal fibroblasts treated with paricalcitol demonstrated significant changes in gene expression, with many upregulated genes identified to have anti-fibrotic effects. However, paricalcitol failed to alter gene expression in Keloid fibroblasts. To investigate this further, we performed RNA sequencing of normal and keloid fibroblasts and found that retinoid-X receptor α (RXRα), a key binding partner of VDR required for downstream transcriptional activation, is significantly downregulated in keloid fibroblasts. Our results indicate that paricalcitol can effectively activate VDR translocation to the nucleus but is unable to effect change at the transcriptional level in keloid fibroblasts, most likely due to the reduced expression of RXRα. This suggests Vitamin D signalling may be aberrant in keloids, and that supplementation with Vitamin D alone would likely be ineffective in restoring signalling.

This knowledge gap hinders the identification of high-risk individuals and the creation of targeted therapies or recommendations to protect these individuals. Here, we employ a genetic approach to identify common variant (minor allele frequency > 0.05) exposure-conditional genetic risk variants that localize with genomic responses to wood smoke particles (WSP), a model of wildfire smoke exposure, and associate with asthma in the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort. Our novel approach used nascent transcriptional signatures derived from WSP-exposed Beas-2B airway epithelial cells to reduce the genome sequence for discovery and allow a permutation-based statistical approach to identify 52 candidate SNPs. We applied biologic and bioinformatic filters to prioritize variants for direct testing of allele-dependent transcriptional regulatory function in plasmid reporters. The rs3861144 variant identified by this approach controls WSP responses of airway epithelial cells to SPRY2, which we showed is involved in mechanical injury repair in cell culture.

The pathophysiology of lung I/R injury involves ferroptosis and elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, while the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on lung I/R injury remains unclear. This research aimed to explore the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on reducing ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells caused by I/R.  First, we identified O-GlcNAc transferase 1 (Ogt1) as a differentially expressed gene in lung epithelial cells of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) patients, using single-cell sequencing, and Gene Ontology analysis (GO analysis) revealed the enrichment of the ferroptosis process. We found a time-dependent dynamic alteration in lung O-GlcNAcylation during I/R injury. Proteomics analysis identified the differentially expressed proteins enriched in ferroptosis and multiple redox-related pathways based on KEGG annotation. Thus, we generated Ogt1-conditional knockout mice and found that Ogt1 deficiency aggravated ferroptosis, as evidenced by lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), Fe2+, as well as alterations in critical protein expression glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Consistently, we found that elevated O-GlcNAcylation inhibited ferroptosis sensitivity in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury-induced TC-1 cells via O-GlcNAcylated NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, both the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that Nrf2 could bind with translation start site (TSS) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and promote its transcriptional activity. As an important rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), elevated G6PDH provided a mass of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to improve the redox state of glutathione (GSH) and eventually led to ferroptosis resistance. Rescue experiments proved that Nrf2 knockdown or Nrf2-T334A (O-GlcNAcylation site) mutation abolished the protective effect of ferroptosis resistance.  In summary, we revealed that O-GlcNAcylation could protect against I/R lung injury by reducing ferroptosis sensitivity via the Nrf2/G6PDH pathway.

We sought to investigate if the GlyR dysfunction in T2D is replicated by hyperglycemia per se, and to further characterize its action in β cells and the islets.   Methods: GlyR-mediated currents were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp in human β cells from donors with or without T2D, or after high glucose culture. We also correlated glycine-induced current amplitude with transcript expression levels through patch-seq. The expression of the GlyR α1, α3, and β subunit mRNA splice variants was compared between islets from donors with and without T2D, and after high glucose culture. Insulin secretion from human islets was measured in the presence or absence of the GlyR antagonist strychnine.  Results: Gene expression of GlyRs was decreased in islets from T2D donors along with smaller GlyR-mediated currents in the β cells. Glycine-induced currents are also reduced in islets from donors without diabetes after 48 hours of culture in high glucose, along with reducedα1 subunit expression and increased  α3 subunit expression. Glycine-evoked currents are highly heterogeneous between different β cells within and between donors; inversely correlated with donor HbA1c; and significantly correlated to the expression of 99 different transcripts.

Here, we show that histone H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac), a mark on newly-synthesized H3, facilitates the remodeling of disorganized nucleosomes in nascent chromatin, and its removal at the subsequent G2/M phase of the cell cycle marks the completion of chromatin maturation. In vitro, H3K56ac enhances the activity of ISWI chromatin remodelers, including yeast ISW1 and its human equivalent SNF2h. In vivo, a deficiency of H3K56ac in nascent chromatin results in the formation of closely packed di-nucleosomes and/or tetra-nucleosomes.

Newly metastasising cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours.  There is interest in exploiting this vulnerability to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis.  Here, we show that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, including with aspirin, enhances immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelet TXA2 triggers an immunosuppressive pathway within T cells dependent upon the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor (TCR)-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases.  Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or through platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner dependent upon T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo.  These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway limiting T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing a mechanistic basis for the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.",15

Here, we investigate the potential of an alternative oxidase (AOX) to counteract cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency in T cells. COX is vital for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and its deficiency leads to redox imbalances, impaired metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis, resulting in T cell immunodeficiency. We introduced an AOX into COX-deficient T cells, which revealed a normalization of genes involved in redox balance, apoptosis, and metabolic pathways. Mitochondrial function, glycolysis and TCA cycle function were also restored. AOX-enhanced T cells showed improved activation, proliferation, differentiation, and memory formation, resulting in better immune responses against viral challenges. These findings suggest that targeting the ubiquinol pool could be a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing T cell function in conditions characterized by COX dysfunction and compromised immune responses.",24

Here, we show that daily cannabidiol (CBD) administration significantly extends lifespan and ameliorates pathology in two LS mouse models, and cellular function in fibroblast from LS patients. CBD delays motor decline and neurodegenerative signs, improves social deficits and breathing abnormalities, decreases thermally induced seizures, and improves neuropathology in affected brain regions. Mechanistically, we identify peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) as a key contributor to CBD’s beneficial effects, and provide proof of dysregulated PPARg expression and activity as a common feature in both mouse neurons and fibroblasts from LS patients.

OXPHOS defects lead to severe human disorders with unexplained tissue specific pathologies. Mitochondrial gene expression is essential for OXPHOS biogenesis since core subunits of the complexes are mitochondrial-encoded. COX14 is required for translation of COX1, the central mitochondrial-encoded subunit of complex IV. Here we describe a COX14 mutant mouse corresponding to a patient with complex IV deficiency. COX14M19I mice display broad tissue-specific pathologies. A hallmark phenotype is severe liver inflammation linked to release of mitochondrial RNA into the cytosol sensed by RIG-1 pathway. We find that mitochondrial RNA release is triggered by increased reactive oxygen species production in the deficiency of complex IV. Additionally, we describe a COA3Y72C mouse, affected in an assembly factor that cooperates with COX14 in early COX1 biogenesis, which displays a similar yet milder inflammatory phenotype.

"GSE231460","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Endothelial ROBO4 suppresses PTGS2/COX-2 expression and inflammatory diseases","Endothelial cells control inflammation in inflammatory and infectious diseases through regulating endothelial gene expression and permeability. Roundabout4 (Robo4) is an endothelial-specific protein that stabilizes endothelial cells. Robo4 has been shown to ameliorate mouse inflammatory and severe infectious diseases, such as sepsis and COVID-19 by reducing vascular permeability. Despite this, it remains uncertain whether these are the only mechanisms by which Robo4 ameliorates the diseases. In this study, we carried out an RNA-seq analysis to investigate the genes regulated by Robo4 in endothelial cells stimulated by TNFα and identified gene, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) , which codes for Cycloocygenase-2 (COX-2). Mechanistic analysis revealed that Robo4 curbs COX-2 expression and endothelial hyperpermeability by preventing prolonged Rac1 activation. Analysis of Robo4 interacting protein identified IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) that maintains active Rac1. Robo4 enhanced ubiquitination of IQGAP1 with a ubiquitin E3 ligase, TNF receptor-associated factor 7 (TRAF7), to inactivate Rac1.  Finally, Robo4 deficiency exacerbates COX-2 -associated inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, edema, and pain in mouse models. Taken together, Robo4 inhibits Rac1 activation by interacting with TRAF7 and IQGAP1, thereby suppressing the endothelial expression of COX-2 and reducing hyperpermeability.  Thus, we uncovered further Robo4 capabilities that suppresses COX-2 and inflammatory diseases, as well as their underlying mechanisms, indicating that endothelial Robo4 is a potential therapeutic target for diverse inflammatory diseases.",12

MEF2C haploinsufficient (MCHS) patients and mice displayed impaired NK cell development, ex vivo function, and increased susceptibility to viral infection. MEF2C was required for cytokine-induced changes in NK cell metabolism and SREBP-mediated lipid homeostasis, and oleic acid supplementation restored MCHS patient NK cell cytotoxic function.

However, its prolonged clinical therapeutic efficacy is still hindered by serious immune rejection from the host immunological responses to the allogeneic hepatocytes and there is still no an effective approach to generate clinically available autologous hepatocytes for transplantation therapy. Here, we report advanced medium conditions that allow 10,000-fold expansion of primary human hepatocytes from patients suffering inherited liver diseases, providing a new autologous hepatocytes source to this problem. Moreover, we developed a CRISPR–Cas9 genome-targeting system that combines Cas9 ribonucleoproteins and adeno-associated viral vector delivery of a homology-independent large donor (greater than three kilobase) to achieve efficient targeted integration at the AAVS1 safe harbor locus in patient-derived proliferating human hepatocytes (ProliHHs). We further applied this strategy to correct a pathogenic OTC and FAH mutation in ProliHHs and demonstrated improved gene expression, while preserving cell viability for the expansion and purification of edited ProliHHs. Importantly, these edited ProliHHs repopulate into injured mouse liver at a level near to primary human hepatocytes, and they undergo maturation to successfully treat the tyrosinemia mouse model following transplantation in vivo. Thus, this study provides a new autologous hepatocyte therapy techniques that enable large-scale expansion and ex vivo gene correction in patient-derived transplantable ProliHHs, which holds the potential for modeling and treating human liver disease.",18

Anterograde regulatory pathways involving a large number of nuclear-encoded proteins control mitochondrial biogenesis and functions. Such functions are deregulated in cancer, resulting in proliferative advantages for cancer cells, aggressive disease and therapeutic resistance. Transcriptional networks controlling the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are known, however alternative splicing (AS) regulation has not been implicated in this communication. Here, we show that IQGAP1, a scaffold protein that regulates AS of distinct gene subsets in gastric cancer cells, participates in AS regulation that strongly affects mitochondrial respiration. Combined proteomic and RNA-seq analyses of IQGAP1KO and parental cells show that IQGAP1KO alters a specific AS event of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (CI) subunit NDUFS4 and downregulates a subset of CI subunits. In IQGAP1KO cells, CI intermediates accumulate resembling assembly deficiencies observed in patients with Leigh syndrome bearing NDUFS4 mutations. Mitochondrial CI activity is significantly lower in KO compared to parental cells, while exogenous expression of IQGAP1 reverses mitochondrial defects of IQGAP1KO cells. Our work sheds light to a novel facet of IQGAP1 in mitochondrial quality control that involves fine-tuning of CI activity through AS regulation in gastric cancer.",6

Our previous observation detailed that microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase 1 (mPGES-1), an enzyme downstream of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), limited antitumor immunity in melanoma; in addition, genetic depletion of mPGES-1 specifically enhanced immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The present study set out to distinguish the roles of mPGES-1 from those of COX-2 in tumor immunity and determine the potential of mPGES-1 inhibitors for reinforcing immunotherapy in melanoma. Genetic deletion of mPGES-1 showed different profiles of prostaglandin metabolites from that of COX-2 deletion. In our syngeneic mouse model, mPGES-1–deficient cells exhibited similar tumorigenicity to that of COX-2–deficient cells, despite a lower ability to suppress PGE2 synthesis by mPGES-1 depletion, indicating the presence of factors other than PGE2 that are likely to regulate tumor immunity. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that mPGES-1 depletion reduced the expressions of collagen-related genes, which have been found to be associated with immunosuppressive signatures. In our mouse model, collagen was reduced in mPGES-1–deficient tumors, and phenotypic analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes indicated that mPGES-1-deficient tumors had fewer TIM3+ exhausted CD8+ T cells compared with COX-2–deficient tumors. CAY10678, an mPGES-1 inhibitor, was equivalent to celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in reinforcing anti–PD-1 treatment.

While most mammalian cells have a circadian clock, their synchronization depends on a central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus that integrates light signals. While peripheral organs can be also synchronized by feeding cues and can be uncoupled from the central pacemaker, no impact of peripheral organs on the central clock has been yet observed. Here, we used a mouse chimeric model in which mouse hepatocytes have been replaced by human hepatocytes that have different circadian and signaling properties to characterize such potential feedback. Remarkably, we observed that liver humanization rewired the liver diurnal gene expression and advance the circadian clock by approximately 4 hours. Strikingly, this phase advance was also observed in the muscle and for the entire rhythmic physiology of the animals, with an impact of human hepatocytes on the circadian function of the central clock. Like mice with a deficient central clock, the humanized animals shifted their physiology more rapidly to the light phase under day feeding.

Almost all A-initiated transcripts have the cap-1 modification, however, the N6-methylation is optional. As a result, A-initiated transcripts in the cell can be Am (cap-1 only) or m6Am (cap-1 and N6-methylation) modified. To study m6Am, we developed CROWN-seq, which simultaneously obtains the transcription-start information and the stoichiometry of N6-methyl. With CROWN-seq, we found that the previous m6Am mapping studies highly underestimated the diversity of the transcription-start site (nucleotide) of the transcriptome. In this study, we used CROWN-seq to reveal m6Am sites and stoichiometry among different human cell lines.

Using conditional CRISPRa technology, we activated the expression of RORβ in mouse pancreatic β-cells and observed that the RORβ-activated animals exhibited diurnal fluctuation of behaviors. Insulin release from islets was directly reduced by pancreatic RORβ activation in the light phase, leading to hippocampal hyperactivity and depression-like behaviors. Further, the hippocampal hyperactivity from the light phase induced a delayed influence to persistently promote insulin release in the dark phase, resulting in a reversion of behaviors and hippocampal activity in the mice, namely, mania-like behaviors and neuronal hypoactivity. Our results might represent a pancreas-hippocampus feedback mechanism by which metabolic and circadian factors cooperate to generate behavioral fluctuations in patients with mental disorders.",38

The mucosa consists of epithelial cells connected by cellular junctions that regulate the passage of nutrients covered by a mucus layer that plays an important role in host-microbiome interactions. Mimicking the intestinal mucosa for in vitro assays, in particular the generation of a viscous mucus layer, has proven to be challenging. Here, we present a novel in vitro intestinal culture model that produces a robust mucus layer and is based on the widely used intestinal Caco-2 cell line. We investigated the effects of air-liquid interface (ALI) culturing compared to liquid-liquid interface (LLI) on Caco-2 cells grown under low-glucose conditions in Transwell plates. In addition, we determined the impact of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) on mucus secretion, epithelial barrier properties and microbe-mucus interactions. A combination of ALI culturing with VIP addition led to formation of a robust mucus layer on the apical surface of the Caco-2 confluent layer in which the intestinal secreted mucin MUC2 was a major component. RNAseq analysis demonstrated upregulation of unique gene clusters in response to ALI and VIP conditions, but the ALI-VIP combination treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of multiple mucin genes and proteins including MUC2, MUC13 and MUC17. Expression of tight junction proteins was significantly altered in the ALI-VIP condition leading to increased permeability to small molecules, more closely reflecting an intestinal epithelium permissive for nutrient uptake. In infection experiments with commensal Lactobacillus plantarum, pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the ALI-VIP mucus layer separated the bacteria from the underlying epithelium.

By tracking pre-defined non-specific B cells, we observed consistent SHM in non-cognate antibody genes after immunization in settings of diverse, polyclonal B and T cells. Removing B cell competition enabled these non-specific yet somatically mutating antibodies to develop entirely new specificities to diverse antigens. Our findings introduce an updated model, where SHM drives antibody diversification without requiring initial antigen specificity.

Consequently, the expression and phosphorylation of the AREG receptor EGFR were upregulated in co-cultured ESCC cells. Moreover, AREG treatment enhanced ESCC cell survival and migration through the EGFR-Erk/p38 signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis of AREG using human ESCC tissues showed a positive correlation between the intensity of AREG expression in tumor invasive front and the expression level of the CAF marker FAP.

However, the role of miRNAs in such processes remains elusive. Here, we show that pancreatic islet miR-27a-5p, which is markedly increased in obese mice and impairs insulin secretion, is mainly delivered by visceral adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Depleting miR-27a-5p significantly improves insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in db/db mice. Supporting the function of EVs’ miR-27a-5p as a key pathogenic factor, intravenous injection of miR-27a-5p-containing EVs shows their distribution in mouse pancreatic islets. Tracing the injected AAV-miR-27a-5p (AAV-miR-27a) or AAV-FABP4-miR-27a-5p (AAV-FABP4-miR-27a) in visceral fat results in upregulating miR-27a-5p in EVs and serum, and elicits mouse pancreatic β-cell dysfunction.

The ability of these cells to elude immune surveillance determines their persistence as latent disease. We report that TGF-β promotes dormancy in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mouse models by placing disseminated SOX2+ and NKX2-1+ progenitors in a quiescent state that biomechanically averts killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. In these primitive progenitors, TGF-β induces an atypical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β drives expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin that changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the stiffness of metastatic progenitors and their killing by mechanosensitive CTLs and NK cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors activate a biomechanical process to evade immune-mediated elimination during prolonged dormancy periods. Inhibiting this process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells.",6

There has been a growing concern about co-exposure to various prevalent lifestyle habits and their role in the enhancement of arsenic toxicity. Smokeless tobacco (SLT) products are extensively consumed in many South Asian countries, where their use frequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To decipher the oral epithelial cell responses to arsenic and SLT alone and in co-exposure, we performed multi-omics analyses of DNA methylome, transcriptomic reprogramming and genotoxic effects in controlled experimental settings. Chronic exposure studies revealed hypomethylation of genes involved in inflammation response and apoptosis, further corroborated by the upregulation of genes involved in these processes due to arsenic and the combined treatment in acute exposure setting. Next, to validate the omics results at the phenotypic level, we observed a dose dependent decrease in cell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes, and an increase in apoptotic cells, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT co-exposure conditions. The observed DNA damage was likely the result of apoptosis induction, as chronic exposure experiments based on whole-exome sequencing did not reveal increased mutagenicity following the arsenic and/or SLT exposure. Our integrative omics study provides insights into both chronic and acute responses to arsenic and SLT co-exposure, with both types of responses converging on some of the same mechanisms. We identified large-scale epigenomic and transcriptomic reprograming associated with arsenic and SLT co-exposure, alongside genotoxic effects presumably manifesting as consequences of apoptosis induction. The findings point to a role of arsenic and SLT in altering key molecular responses, especially in the context of the co-exposure, and call for further studies in humans in the areas of exposure, to validate the observed mechanisms.",16

Cell states are defined by their epigenetic landscape and have cell state-specific metabolic demands. Defining the regulatory factors involved in the interplay between metabolism and cell state would represent a significant step forward in understanding the genetic circuitry that drives differentiation of progenitor cells into highly specialized cell types for proper tissue formation. Expression levels of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) mega-cluster have been shown to correlate with distinct metabolic profiles in a variety of progenitor cells, suggesting it functions as a key regulator of metabolism and cell state. Here, we directly demonstrate that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a central player coordinating mitochondrial metabolic activity and genome-wide epigenetic changes in myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Stable muscle cell lines were generated harboring two distinct deletions in the proximal promoter region resulting in either greatly upregulated or severely attenuated transcription of the entire mega-cluster of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. Both mutant lines displayed impaired myotube formation along with perturbed mitochondrial respiration and widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and histone methylation. Global gene expression patterns and pathway analyses indicated a reprogramming of cell state which created a differentiated-like molecular profile in proliferating myoblasts. Our results strongly suggest that the Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNA locus is a nodal regulator coordinating metabolic activity and the epigenome to maintain proper cell state in the myogenic lineage.",18

The effector cells of fibrosis are myofibroblasts, an activated form of fibroblast. In gingiva (gums), fibrotic responses are predominantly hyperproliferative (hyperplasia), where transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is overexpressed, and via canonical signaling pathway acts on gingival fibroblasts to induce fibroproliferative genes such as cellular communications network factor 2 (CCN2). Targeting of TGFβ for therapeutic gain however is challenging due its pleotropic nature, and therefore identifying new and targetable alternatives is warranted. We have shown that mechanical tension as a result of stiff ECM increases TGFβ-driven expression of CCN2 in gingival fibroblasts. We further identified yes-activated protein (YAP1), a mechanosensitive transcription (co)factor that translocate to nucleus in response to mechanical tension in gingival fibroblasts. To test if YAP is the perpetuator of TGFβ-mediated fibroproliferative gene induction, I used celastrol, a recently identified YAP/TAZ (transcriptional co-activator PDZ-binding motif) inhibitor, whose anti-fibrotic potential is not yet elucidated -- projecting it as a potential treatment option for gingival hyperplasia.  Methods: Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) in culture were serum starved overnight and pretreated with 500nM Celastrol or DMSO for 45 minutes followed by stimulation with or without TGFβ1 for 6 hours (RT-PCR) and 24 hours (Western blot). mRNA samples collected at 6 hours were also analysed using BulkRNAsequencing and functional cluster analysis. Celastrol’s capacity to prevent the TGFβ induced proliferation of HGFs was investigated with BrdU cell proliferation assay. Celastrol’s ability to block TGFβ-mediated YAP nuclear localization in HGFs was assessed using immunofluorescent staining of YAP protein.  Results: In response to added TGFβ1, the gene and protein expression of fibrotic marker and mediator CCN2 (a known YAP1 target) was significantly downregulated in the presence of Celastrol. Similarly, of the 1364 genes induced by TGFβ1 (>2-fold), 657 genes showed a >50% decrease in the presence of Celastrol including genes involved in fibrotic responses such as type 4 collagen, interleukin 11, etc., Functional cluster analysis revealed ECM, Wnt/cytokine signaling, focal adhesion clusters induced by added TGFβ1, were downregulated in a Celastrol sensitive fashion. Also, basal level proliferation of HGFs was repressed in the presence of Celastrol. Additionally, Celastrol also successfully blocked TGFβ-mediated nuclear translocation of YAP as seen with immunofluorescence microscopy.  Conclusion: These results are consistent with our hypothesis that targeting YAP/TAZ may be useful in blocking the profibrotic effects of TGFβ and that celastrol or other YAP inhibitors are eligible candidates as a treatment option for gingival hyperplasia.",8

While the analgesic properties of small molecules and peptides have been primarily tested on isolated murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, emerging strategies to develop, study, and characterise human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived sensory neurons present a promising alternative. In this study, hPSCs were efficiently differentiated into peripheral DRG-induced sensory neurons (iSNs) using a combined chemical and transcription factor-driven approach, via a neural crest cell intermediate. Molecular characterisation and transcriptomic analysis confirmed the expression of key DRG markers such as BRN3A, ISLET1, and PRPH, in addition to GABABR and ion channels including CaV2.2 and GIRK1 in iSNs. Functional characterisation of GABABR was conducted using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, assessing neuronal excitability under current clamp conditions in the absence and presence of GABABR agonists baclofen and α-conotoxin Vc1.1. Both baclofen (100 mM) and Vc1.1 (1 mM) significantly reduced membrane excitability by hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential, and increasing the rheobase for action potential firing. In voltage-clamp mode, baclofen and Vc1.1 inhibited HVA Ca2+ channel currents, which were attenuated by the selective GABABR antagonist CGP 55845. However, modulation of GIRK channels by GABABRs was not observed in the presence of baclofen or Vc1.1, suggesting that functional GIRK1/2 channels were not coupled to GABABRs in hPSC-derived iSNs. This study reports is the first to report GABABR modulation of membrane excitability in iSNs by baclofen and Vc1.1, highlighting their potential as a future model for studying analgesic compounds.",3

A major hypothesis to explain disease aetiology comprises synaptic dysfunction associated with excitatory-inhibitory imbalance of synaptic transmission, ultimately contributing to impaired network oscillation and cognitive deficits associated with the disease. Here, we studied the morphological and functional properties of a highly defined co-culture of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from patients with idiopathic SCZ. Our results indicate upregulation of synaptic genes and increased excitatory synapse formation on GABAergic neurons in co-cultures. In parallel, we observed decreased lengths of axon initial segments, concordant with data from postmortem brains from patients with SCZ. Patch-clamp analyses revealed differential processing of excitatory input with markedly increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) recorded from GABAergic SCZ neurons and decreased spontaneous EPSC from glutamatergic SCZ neurons. Likewise, we observed decreased amplitudes of calcium signals selectively in GABAergic neurons while frequency was increased in both neuronal populations. Finally, MEA recordings from neuronal networks indicate increased synchronization of network activity. In conclusion, our results suggest selective deregulation of neuronal activity and synaptic transmission in SCZ samples, providing evidence for differential signal processing in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons as a potential base for aberrant network synchronization.",14

To investigate in vivo mechanisms of Fyn driven neurodegeneration, we built a zebrafish neural specific Gal4:UAS model of constitutively active FynY531F signaling. Using in vivo live imaging we demonstrate neural FynY531F expression leads to dopaminergic neuron loss and mitochondrial aggregation in 5 day larval brain. Gene expression analyses reveal reduction in neuroprotective genes, and elevated inflammatory cytokines Il-1β, IL-12 and TNF-α and genes associated with oxidative stress. These phenotypes correlate with microglia activation in the larval brain. Chemical inhibition demonstrates dopaminergic neuron loss is dependent on Fyn and NF-κB/Caspase 1 signaling. We identify Stat3 activation as a novel downstream effector of Fyn signaling that acts synergistically with NF-κB in dopaminergic neuron degeneration. These results show Fyn drives neurodegeneration through NF-κB inflammatory signaling and Stat3 pathways. Activation of Stat3 provides a potential link from Fyn to mitochondrial dysfunction associated with dopaminergic neuron loss.",24

The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) gives rise to two major cortical interneuron (cIN) populations, marked by Somatostatin (Sst) and Parvalbumin (Pvalb), which develop on different timelines. The extent to which external signals influence these identities remains poorly understood. Pvalb-positive cINs are particularly important for regulating cortical circuits through strong perisomatic inhibition, yet they have been difficult to model in vitro. Here we investigated the role of the environment in shaping and maintaining Pvalb cINs. We grafted mouse MGE progenitors into a variety of 2D and 3D coculture models, including mouse and human cortical, MGE, and thalamic systems with dissociated cells, organoids, organotypic cultures, and conditioned media. Across models, we observed distinct proportions of Sst- and Pvalb-positive cIN descendants. Strikingly, grafting MGE progenitors into 3D human, but not mouse, corticogenesis models led to efficient, non-autonomous differentiation of Pvalb-positive cINs. This differentiation was characterized by upregulation of Pvalb maturation markers, downregulation of Sst-specific markers, and the formation of perineuronal nets. Furthermore, lineage-traced postmitotic Sst-positive cINs, when grafted, also upregulated Pvalb expression. These results reveal an unexpected level of fate plasticity in MGE-derived cINs, demonstrating that their identities can be dynamically shaped by the surrounding environment.",1

The adaptive responses from midbrain dopamine neurons to artificial rewards such as drugs of abuse are therefore important for understanding the development of substance use disorders. Drug-induced changes in gene expression are one such adaptation that can determine the activity of dopamine signaling in projection regions of the brain reward system. One of the major challenges to obtaining this understanding is the inherent cellular heterogeneity in the brain, where each neuron population can be defined by a distinct transcriptional profile. To bridge this gap, we have adapted a virus-based method for labeling and capture of dopamine nuclei, coupled with nuclear RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, to study the transcriptional adaptations, specifically, of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) during cocaine taking and cocaine craving, using a mouse model of cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA). Our results show significant changes in gene expression across non-drug operant training, cocaine taking, and cocaine craving, highlighted by an enrichment in expression of repressive epigenetic modifying enzymes during cocaine craving. Immunohistochemical validation further revealed an increase of H3K9me3 deposition in DA neurons during cocaine craving. These results demonstrate that cocaine-induced transcriptional adaptations in dopamine neurons vary by phase of self-administration and suggest that such an approach may be useful in identifying relevant phase-specific molecular targets to alter the behavioral course of substance use disorders.",15

One unique feature of paired-class HD is cooperative dimerization on specific palindrome DNA sequences. Yet, the functional significance of HD cooperative dimerization in animal development and its dysregulation in diseases remain elusive. Using the retinal TF Cone-rod Homeobox (CRX) as a model, we have studied how blindness-causing mutations in the paired HD, p.E80A and p.K88N, alter CRX’s cooperative dimerization, lead to gene misexpression and photoreceptor developmental deficits in dominant manners. CRXE80A maintains binding at monomeric WT CRX motifs but is deficient in cooperative binding at dimeric motifs. CRXE80A’s dimerization defect impacts the exponential increase of photoreceptor gene expression in terminal differentiation and produces immature, non-functional photoreceptors in the CrxE80A retinas. CRXK88N is highly cooperative and localizes to ectopic genomic sites with strong enrichment of dimeric HD motifs. CRXK88N’s altered biochemical properties disrupt CRX’s ability to direct dynamic chromatin remodeling during development to activate photoreceptor differentiation programs and silence progenitor programs. Our study here provides in vitro and in vivo molecular evidence that paired-class HD cooperative dimerization regulates neuronal development and dysregulation of cooperative binding contributes to severe dominant blinding retinopathies.",18

However, the molecular basis for this functional heterogeneity are poorly understood. Here, a voltage-gated potassium (K+) channel named KCNB1 (alias Kv2.1), formed stable complexes with the leptin receptor (LepR) in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expressing neurons of the Arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARCPOMC). Mice lacking functional KCNB1 channels (NULL mice), exhibited constitutive depolarization of ARCPOMC neurons along with aberrant POMC production. In NULL neurons, canonical LepR-STAT3 signaling--which underlies POMC production--was impaired, whereas non-canonical insulin receptor substrate PI3K/Akt/FOXO1 and ERK signaling were significantly upregulated. Accordingly, the NULL animals were insensitive to anorexic stimuli induced by leptin administration and produced less adipose tissue and circulating leptin than WT animals. Taken together, these findings unveil an exquisite mechanism of metabolic regulation whereby synergistic control of neuronal excitability and endocrine function is achieved through the partnership between a K+ channel and a hormone receptor. As aberrant KCNB1 channels cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, these results further establish a K+ channel as a causative link between epileptic and metabolic disorders.",6

This repeat expansion undergoes bidirectional transcription to produce sense and antisense repeat RNA species. Both sense and antisense-derived repeat RNAs undergo repeat-associated non-AUG translation in all reading frames to generate five distinct dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Importantly, toxicity has been associated with both sense and antisense repeat-derived RNA and DPRs. This suggests targeting both sense and antisense repeat RNA may provide the most effective therapeutic strategy. The RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 systems offer a promising avenue for simultaneous targeting of multiple RNA transcripts, as they mature their own guide arrays, thus allowing targeting of more than one RNA species from a single construct. We show that CRISPR-Cas13d originating from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) can successfully reduce C9orf72 sense and antisense repeat transcripts and DPRs to background levels in HEK cells overexpressing C9orf72 repeats. CRISPR-CasRx also markedly reduced the endogenous sense and antisense repeat RNAs and DPRs in three independent C9orf72 patient-derived iPSC-neuron lines, without detectable off-target effects. To determine whether CRISPR-CasRx is effective in vivo, we treated two distinct C9orf72 repeat mouse models using AAV delivery and observed a significant reduction in both sense and antisense repeat-containing transcripts. Taken together this work highlights the potential for RNA-targeting CRISPR systems as therapeutics for C9orf72 ALS/FTD.",14

The somata of 5-HT neurons from seven subpopulations (PT, SR-R, SR-M, SR-C, IR-R, IR-C, MO) were visualized under a fluorescence microscopy, then targeted and collected separately using glass electrode. For each sample, 10-12 neurons were collected and transferred to lysis buffer solution. Total RNA was extracted for construction of cDNA libraries, involving fragmentation, PCR enrichment, N7 index linking, and purification. A total of 71 QuantSeq libraries (N=9-12 samples for each subpopulation) were prepared using the Lexogen’s QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was carried out using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with 150 bp paired-end reads. Gene expression level analysis was performed using R (Version 4.3.1) package Seurat (Version 5.0.2), and the mean gene expression matrix of all samples was obtained after processing by NormalizeData function. For marker gene analysis of each subpopulation, FindAllMarkers function in Seurat was used, with parameters set as min.pct=0.1 and logfc.threshold=0.25. Differential expression analysis revealed that each subpopulation expressed a set of featured genes, including specific markers for neurotransmitters, axon projection, neuron development, synapse, and ion channels, suggesting that seven 5-HT neuronal subpopulations display distinct genetic profiles.

The APOE ε2 encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE2) is a protective allele against AD among the three genotypes (APOE ε2, ε3, ε4), while APOE4 is the strongest genetic factor substantially increasing AD risk. APOE regulates brain lipid homeostasis and maintaining synaptic plasticity and neuronal function, where APOE2 has a superior function compared to APOE3 and APOE4. Gene therapy that increases APOE2 levels in the brain is, therefore, a promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. We previously reported that PEGylated liposomes conjugated with transferrin and a cell-penetrating peptide Penetratin sufficiently deliver chitosan-APOE2 cDNA plasmid complex into the brain of wild-type mice. Here, we investigated how brain-targeting liposome-based APOE2 gene delivery influences Aβ)-related pathologies in amyloid model AppNL-G-F knockin mice at 12-month-old. We found a trend of reductions of insoluble Aβ levels in the mouse cortices 1 month after APOE2 gene therapy. Furthermore, in the AppNL-G-F knockin mice that received the APOE2 gene therapy, brain transcriptome analysis through RNA-sequencing identified the upregulation of genes/pathways related to neuronal development. This was supported by increases of Dlg4 and Syp mRNAs coding synaptic proteins in the experimental group. On the other hand, we found that APOE2 gene delivery increased soluble Aβ levels, including oligomers, as well as exacerbated neurite dystrophy and decreased synaptophysin. Together, our results suggest that brain-targeting liposome-based APOE2 gene therapy is potentially beneficial for synaptic formation at the transcriptional level. Forced APOE2 expressions, however, may exacerbate Aβ toxicity by increasing the dissociation of Aβ oligomers from aggregates in the presence of considerable amyloid burden.",23

It is characterized by weakness, frequent falls, cognitive decline, increased hospitalization and dead, and represents a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The fact that frailty is recognized as a reversible condition, encourages the identification of earlier biomarkers to timely predict and prevent its occurrence. SAMP8 (Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone-8) mice represent the most appropriate preclinical model to this aim and were used in this study to carry transcriptional and metabolic analyses in the brain and plasma respectively, upon a characterization at cognitive, motor, structural and neuropathological level at 2.5, 6 and 9 months of age. At 2.5 months SAMP8 mice started displaying memory deficits, muscle weakness and motor impairment. Functional alterations were associated with a neurodevelopment deficiency associated with reduced neuronal density and glial cell loss. Through transcriptomics we identified specific genetic signatures well distinguishing SAMP8 mice at 6 months and correlating with motor and cognitive dysfunction, whereas plasma metabolomics allowed to segregate SAMP8 mice from SAMR1 already at 2.5 months of age by detecting constitutively lower levels of acylcarnitines and lipids in SAMP8 at all ages investigated.

ILC2s expanded and produced IL-13 in the developing brain meninges. Loss of ILC2s or IL-13 signaling to interneurons decreased inhibitory, but not excitatory, cortical synapses.

The neurovascular unit (NVU), essential for blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and comprised of endothelial cells, glial cells (microglia and astrocytes), and neurons, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of obesity on endothelial and other cells of and its contribution to neurodegeneration remains largely unknown. In this study we aimed to decipher in-dept molecular modifications induced by obesity in cells of neurovascular unit by integrative multiomics analysis of endothelial cells, neurons, microglial cells, and astrocytes from the hippocampus of ob/ob mice. Hippocampus were isolated from ob/ob and C57BL/6J male mice at 17-18 weeks of age. Gene expression profiles of cells of hippocampus were obtained using single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) and data analyzed using in-dept bioinformatic analyses. snRNAseq and UMAP analysis revealed 19 cell types in hippocampus. Comparisons of global gene expression profiles identified different global profiles between ob/ob and WT for each of the cell types of the NVU. Statistical analyses revealed 4463 DEGs in neuronal cells, 1386 DEGs in astrocytes, 125DEGs in endothelial cells, and 155 DEGs in microglia cells, suggesting that obesity significantly impacts the expression profiles of NUV cells. Enrichment analyses revealed that these genes are involved in cellular processing like focal adhesion, cell interactions, inflammation, and metabolism. Changes in the expression in endothelial cells were positively correlated with genomic changes in other cell types, changes that we correlated with tendency in increase in BBB observed using functional MRI.

The aortic valve (AoV) extracellular matrix is generated and maintained by valvular interstitial cells (VICs), a heterogeneous population of cells derived from a mixture of developmental precursors such as endocardium, neural crest and second heart field. Although most studies have focused on VICs that exhibit a fibroblastic phenotype, significant subpopulations present with neuronal, glial, smooth muscle and melanocytic phenotypes. Relatively little is known about which sub population of VICs regulate and produce elastic fibers, though elastin (Eln) abnormalities result in congenital AoV defects and Eln degradation initiates AoV diseases. The present study establishes the timing ofElnexpression in the murine AoV. We performed RT-qPCR and found thatElnpeaks at late embryogenesis (embryonic day 17.5) and early postnatal (P) stages and decreases to low levels in adulthood. Using spatial transcriptomics in postnatal day 3 AoV, we segregated AoV cells from other cardiac cells and demonstrated thatElnexpression correlates with that of genes known to regulate elastogenesis, including the common smooth muscle cell marker - Acta2. By combining RNAscopein situhybridization with immunofluorescence, we confirmed that VICs that expressElnco-express alpha smooth muscle actin. Additionally, some of theEln/alpha smooth muscle actin expressing cells also express melanocytic markers.

In the present study, Nos1 conditional knockout mice were constructed, and we found that selective deletion of Nos1 in hilar interneurons rather than dentate granular cells (DGCs) triggered epileptogenesis. The level of nNOS was downregulated in patients and mice with TLE. Nos1 deletion led to excessive epilepsy-like excitatory input circuit formation and hyperexcitation of DGCs. Replenishment of hilar nNOS protein blocked epileptogenic development and memory impairment in pilocarpine-induced TLE mice. Moreover, chronic treatment with DETA/NONOate, a slowly released exogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor, prevented aberrant neural circuits of DGCs and the consequent epileptogenesis without acute antiseizure effects.

Here, we show that Netrin-1/Unc5b and Norrin/Lrp5 signaling establish a zonated endothelial cell gene expression program that controls BRB integrity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of postnatal BRB-competent mouse retina endothelial cells (ECs), we investigate >100 BRB genes encoding Wnt signaling components, tight junction proteins, and ion and nutrient transporters. We find that BRB gene expression is zonated across arteries, capillaries, and veins and regulated by opposing gradients of the Netrin-1 receptor Unc5b and Lrp5-β-catenin signaling between retinal arterioles and venules. Mice deficient for Ntn1 or Unc5b display more BRB leakage at the arterial end of the vasculature, while Lrp5 loss of function causes predominantly venular BRB leakage. ScRNA-seq of Ntn1 and Unc5b mutant ECs reveals down-regulated β-catenin signaling and  BRB gene expression that is rescued by Ctnnb1 overactivation, along with BRB integrity. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 and Norrin additively enhance β-catenin transcriptional activity and Lrp5 phosphorylation via the Discs large homologue 1 (Dlg1) scaffolding protein, and endothelial Lrp5-Unc5b function converges in protection of capillary BRB integrity.

The pathophysiology of lung I/R injury involves ferroptosis and elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, while the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on lung I/R injury remains unclear. This research aimed to explore the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on reducing ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells caused by I/R.  First, we identified O-GlcNAc transferase 1 (Ogt1) as a differentially expressed gene in lung epithelial cells of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) patients, using single-cell sequencing, and Gene Ontology analysis (GO analysis) revealed the enrichment of the ferroptosis process. We found a time-dependent dynamic alteration in lung O-GlcNAcylation during I/R injury. Proteomics analysis identified the differentially expressed proteins enriched in ferroptosis and multiple redox-related pathways based on KEGG annotation. Thus, we generated Ogt1-conditional knockout mice and found that Ogt1 deficiency aggravated ferroptosis, as evidenced by lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), Fe2+, as well as alterations in critical protein expression glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Consistently, we found that elevated O-GlcNAcylation inhibited ferroptosis sensitivity in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury-induced TC-1 cells via O-GlcNAcylated NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, both the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that Nrf2 could bind with translation start site (TSS) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and promote its transcriptional activity. As an important rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), elevated G6PDH provided a mass of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to improve the redox state of glutathione (GSH) and eventually led to ferroptosis resistance. Rescue experiments proved that Nrf2 knockdown or Nrf2-T334A (O-GlcNAcylation site) mutation abolished the protective effect of ferroptosis resistance.  In summary, we revealed that O-GlcNAcylation could protect against I/R lung injury by reducing ferroptosis sensitivity via the Nrf2/G6PDH pathway. Our work will provide a new basis for clinical therapeutic strategies for pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute lung injury.",2
"GSE281884","Mus musculus","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing","Platelet thromboxane limits T cell immunity to cancer metastasis via ARHGEF1","Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally.  Newly metastasising cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours.  There is interest in exploiting this vulnerability to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis.  Here, we show that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, including with aspirin, enhances immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelet TXA2 triggers an immunosuppressive pathway within T cells dependent upon the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor (TCR)-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases.  Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or through platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner dependent upon T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo.  These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway limiting T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing a mechanistic basis for the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.",15

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an anti-inflammatory drug approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. We previously reported that DMF effectively inhibits acute GVHD (aGVHD) while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, the role of DMF in cGVHD progression remains unknown. Here, we found that DMF administration significantly suppresses follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation, germinal center formation and alleviates disease severity in different murine cGVHD models. Mechanistically, DMF treatment downregulates IL-21 transcription by activation of Nrf2, thus orchestrating Tfh-related gene program both in mice and humans. The inhibitory role of DMF on Tfh cell differentiation was diminished in Nrf2 deficient T cells. Importantly, the therapeutic potential of DMF in clinical cGVHD has been validated in human data whereby DMF effectively reduces IL-21 production and Tfh cell generation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from active cGVHD patients and further attenuates xenograft GVHD. Collectively, our findings reveal that DMF potently inhibits cGVHD development by repressing Tfh cell differentiation via Nrf2, paving way for the treatment of cGVHD in the clinic.",4

However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this critical process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac), a mark on newly-synthesized H3, facilitates the remodeling of disorganized nucleosomes in nascent chromatin, and its removal at the subsequent G2/M phase of the cell cycle marks the completion of chromatin maturation. In vitro, H3K56ac enhances the activity of ISWI chromatin remodelers, including yeast ISW1 and its human equivalent SNF2h. In vivo, a deficiency of H3K56ac in nascent chromatin results in the formation of closely packed di-nucleosomes and/or tetra-nucleosomes. In contrast, abnormally high H3K56ac levels disrupt chromatin maturation, leading to genome instability. These findings establish a central role of H3K56ac in chromatin maturation and reveal a mechanism regulating this critical aspect of chromosome replication.",116

Single-cell RNAseq analysis of MHCII-mismatched heart transplants developing chronic rejection identified graft IL-33 as a stimulator of tissue repair pathways in infiltrating myeloid cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Using IL-33-deficient donor mice, it was revealed that graft fibroblast-derived IL-33 potently induced Amphiregulin (Areg) expression by recipient Treg. Areg is an epidermal growth factor secreted by multiple immune cells to shape immunomodulation and tissue repair. In particular, Areg is proposed to play a major role in Treg-mediated muscle, epithelium, and nerve repair. Assessing recipient mice with Treg-specific deletion of Areg demonstrated that this pathway surprisingly contributes to chronic rejection. Specifically, heart transplants from recipients with Areg-deficient Tregs exhibited less vasculopathy and vessel-associated fibrotic niches infiltrated by recipient T cells. Mechanistically, we show that Areg does not impact Treg suppressive function, but that IL-33 mediated Treg-secretion of Areg increases fibroblast proliferation and migration. In total, these studies identify how a dysregulated repair response involving interactions between IL-33+ fibroblasts in the allograft and recipient Treg contributes to the progression of chronic rejection.",2
"GSE176188","Homo sapiens","Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other","Sodium phenylbutyrate rescues thyroid hormone transport in brain endothelial cells","Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency is a rare genetic disease leading to a severe developmental delay. Some MCT8 deficient patients are not as severely affected than others due to residual thyroid hormone (TH) transport. Previously, we hypothesized that these patients’ mutations destabilize the MCT8 protein, which consequently will be sent for degradation. We have already demonstrated that the chemical chaperone sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) rescues the function of these mutants by stabilizing their protein expression in an overexpressing cell system. Here we expand our previous work and used human iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMECs) as a model. We could show that NaPB rescues decreased mutant MCT8 expression and restores transport function. Furthermore, we identified MCT10 as another TH transporter that contributes to T3 uptake. The decrease in mutant protein expression could be explained by the activation of components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) machinery. Increased expression after NaPB treatment is a consequence of UPR attenuation and the stabilization of MCT8 mRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that NaPB is suitable to stabilize pathogenic missense mutations and activate transport function in a human-derived cell model opening the possibility of repurposing the FDA-approved drug NaPB for MCT8 deficiency.",19

One of the main difficulties associated with cellular therapy approaches is the generation and expansion of mature autologous hepatocytes. The ability to derive patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have solved the problem of generating autologous cells but differentiation and expansion of mature hepatocytes remain a challenge. Here, we report the generation of human iPSC-derived hepatic organoid (eHEPO) culture system for producing functional hepatocytes using EpCAM-positive endodermal cells as an intermediate. eHEPOs can be produced within two weeks and expanded long-term without any lose of differentiation capacity to mature hepatocyte (>12 months with passage number 25) and are resilient to freeze-thaw cycles. The hepatic identity of eHEPOs was confirmed by morphological analyses, expression of mature hepatocyte markers and in vitro functional assays. Extensive global transcriptome analyses of all intermediate stages demonstrated the stepwise differentiation iPSCs to mature hepatocytes in endoderm-derived organoids. Finally, starting form patient-specific iPSCs, we created an organoid-based model of Citrullinemia type 1, an inherited urea cycle disorder caused by mutations in the argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) enzyme. The disease-related ammonia accumulation phenotype in eHEPOs could be reversed by the overexpression of the wild type ASS1 gene which also indicated that this model is amenable to genetic manipulation.

To gain greater insight into the unique neuromotor features, we performed gene expression profiling of the motor cortex of a well-characterized murine model of the disorder. Co-expression network analysis suggested an abnormality with myelination, which was supported by limited existing human data. Utilizing electron microscopy, marked dysmyelination was detected in 2-week-old homozygous ARG1 knockout mice. The corticospinal tract was found to be adversely affected, supporting dysmyelination as the cause of the unique neuromuscular features and implicating oligodendrocyte impairment in a deficiency of hepatic ARG1. Following neonatal hepatic gene therapy to express ARG1, the subcortical white matter, pyramidal tract, and corticospinal tract all showed a remarkable recovery in terms of myelinated axon density and ultrastructural integrity with active wrapping of axons by nearby oligodendrocyte processes. These findings support the following conclusions: first, arginase deficiency is a leukodystrophy affecting the brain and spinal cord while sparing the peripheral nervous system; and second, neonatal AAV hepatic gene therapy can rescue the defects associated with myelinated axons, strongly implicating the functional recovery of oligodendrocytes after restoration of hepatic arginase activity.

To address this question we performed transcriptomic analysis in mice with inducible and conditional ablation of the circadian clock system in the renal tubular cells (Bmal1lox/lox/Pax8-rtTA/LC1 mice). Deep sequencing of the renal transcriptome revealed significant changes in the expression of genes related to metabolic pathways and organic anion transport. In parallel, kidneys from Bmal1lox/lox/Pax8-rtTA/LC1 mice exhibited a significant decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio suggesting an increased anaerobic glycolysis and/or decreased mitochondrial function. In-depth analysis of two selected pathways revealed (i) a significant increase in plasma urea levels correlating with increased renal arginase 2 (Arg2) activity, hyperargininemia and increase of the kidney arginine content; (ii) a significantly increased plasma creatinine concentration and reduced capacity of the kidney to secrete anionic drugs (furosemide), paralleled by a ~80% decrease in the expression levels of organic anion transporter OAT3 (SLC22a8).
